AN APPALLING SCENE OF PANIC AND SUF-
FERING.
THE BROOKLYN THEATER TAKES FIRE WHILE
FILLED WITH PEOPLE.
THE FIRE STARTING IN THE BCENERY DURING THE
LAST ACT OF THE “TWO ORPHANS ”—FRANTIC
TERROR OF THE AUDIENCE—A MAD RUSH FOR
THE DOORS—MANY PERSONS INJURED—THE
THEATER TOTALLY DESTROYED —EXCITEMENT IN
BOTH NEW-YORK AND BROOKLYN EAGER
CROWDS HASTENING TO THE SCENZ.
One of the most unfortunate and disastréus fires
that has ever occurred in the city of Brooklyn
broke out in the Brooklyn Theater last evening,
destroying the entire building, and resulting in
serious ipjury to many people. The audience-
room was crowded with people assembled
to witness the rendering of the “Two Or
phans” by Shook Palmer's company. The last act
had been reached, when a light fell from the upper
part of the stage scenery upon a canvas roof below,
setting it on fire. The employés of the theater at-
tempted to extinguish the flames, and at first seemed
to succeed. Miss Kate Claxton came to the front
of the stage and told the audience to remain perfectly
quiet and no harm would be done, The people
were quiet for a moment, when the whole
scenery burst into one sheet of flame and the room
was filled almost at once with smoke. A panic im-
mediately ensued and the people rushed for the
doors. Men, women, and children, in one solid
mass, pressed and crowded for the places of exit,
trampling upon the weaker ones and retarding their
own progress by their haste, The scene about the
theater in the street was a heart-rending one. Many
who escaped uninjured rushed wildly about inquir-
ing for their missing friends. Persons inscnsible
or disabled by injuries were carried rapidly away
to secure places. Many were taken into the Iirst
Precinet Station, which was filled with the injured
persons and their friends. Some lay upon the floor
insensible, while friends were doing everything in
their power to restore them to consciousness, Others
were wildly frantic, and with blood streaming down
their faces or clothing were gesticulating and scream-
ing, and could not be quieted. Ambulances from the
Long Island College Hospital took away the wounded
as rapidly as possible, From the street, as the crowd
was surging from the building, the moans and cries
of those suffering or in wild alarm for their lives
could be distinctly heard. Some attempted te save
themselves by seeking quicker egress than through
the doors. One man dropped from the upper win-
dows to the small roof of the police station, and was
rescued from the billiard rooms of A. R. Samuclls
by persons who saw his wretched plight, The
flesh dropped from his hands in shreds,
Those who were the Jast to come out
were chased rapidly by the flames and in not a few
instances severely burned; but many more were in-
jured by the press of the erowd. If one fell down
there was no possibility of raising him and the oth-
ers behind rushed over and trampled upon him,
One of the actors was in a saloon opposite the
theater door, and saw the first breaking out of the
fire from the building. He said that the flames
seemed to burst out as if with a silent explosion,
and ina moment the whole top of the building
seemed to be ablaze, This was the first intimation
he had of any fire, and at that time no
one seemed to have come out of the theater,
When he and those with him rushed over to the
side door they found it fastened, and they were una-
able to gain an entrance. By this time the people
were pouring from the doors, and their assistance
was required to assist the wounded. Another actor
who was on the stage at the time and saw the
origin of the fire said that the first spark
caught from one of the board-lights,” An
effort was made to extioguish this by cutting the
fixtures from above, In the scene presented there
was a canvas covering extending over the stage, rep-
resenting the roof of a house, The burning pieces
cut from above, instead of falling upon the floor
of the stage where they could be extin-
guished, fell upon this canvas roof and
almost immediately the whole ignited and the
flames and smoke hid the audience and drove every
one from the stage. The last persons to leave were
seene-shifters Cumbersen, Reilly, and Pulliss,
Puiliss said that he eut the gas fittures
above, but the quek igniting of the can-
vass below baflied all efforts to stop the fire.
These three Im were the last to go out from
the theater. Puliiss was very sure that when he
came ont there was then no other person in the
andience-room, and stoutly contradic ted those who
affirmed that some were seen burning in the room.
Ciinberson was badly burned and bruised, and
some fears were entertained of his dying.
Reilly escaped unbmit, The story of the alarm
and subsequent incidents were repeated by persons
in the audience. One sitting in the orchestra stated
that at the first blaze the greater portion of the
andience arose to their feet. The appeal of Miss
Claxton quieted them, and most of them resumed
their seals. When the fire sprung up
from the canvas, a man stood up on one of
the seats and in a loud voice asked
all to remain in their places until the way could be
cleared, and then to go out quietly. They seemed to
heed what was said until another shouted, “It's
time we were out of this,” when the panic began.
The orchestra seats and dress circle were not
crowded, and those in them escaped with little
difficulty. The galleries wero full, however,
and there were many children among the occu-
pants, One of the persons in the gallery said that
he himself was carried along by the crowd, and
could do nothing to hasten or check his course or
render any assistance to those who fell, One little
girl in some way became entangled in the erowd
and slipped under their feet, Nothing could be
done to prevent those behind stepping upon her in
passin z. Fortunately she was rescued alive,
In an incredibly short space of time, W ashington
and Jobnon-ste, were crowded with an excited mul-
titude, Lich it required all the efforts of the police
to restrain within due bounds. The flames leaping
heavenward and rising higl
tall buildings, lighted up all the adjacent streets and
the burrying throngs which poured in from all
directions. Safety ropes were stretched across
Washinglon-st. in front of The Arqus Office, and
‘also at the corner of Washington and Johnson-sts,
These were guarded by a strong force of police, and
such excellent order was maintained that, despite
the great crowd, the narrow streets, and the intense
excitement, no serious accidents wm the streets were
reported. The flames seemed to act as a beacon for
curious seekers after the sensational from New-
York, and shortly after the flames broke out the
various ferries were crowded, and all the ways lead-
ing to the fire seemed as busy as at midday.
Soon after the first alarm was given the flames
burst through the roof and rose in pexfectly straight
columns of pure flame. There was an unusually
small amount of smoke, and the might being clear
and still, the effect was singularly beautiful. First
a huge pyramid of fire was outlined
against the sky, the apex continually chang-
ing in form; then two parallel columus ap-
peared, one on each side, and finally are
were merged into one broad blaze of burning build-
ings, which, with a mighty roar, wrapped the
theater and the adjacent structure in its embrace
and licked out hungry tongues of flame far across
the street. The flames ran along the cornices of the
buildings in Washington-st.,, but the powerful
streams from several engines sufficed to hold them
in check and prevent the destruction of the entire
block, which would certainly have followed had
these buildings become well on fire.
The rapidity with which the interior of the theater
burned was soon apparent to those near at hand.
above the roofs of the.
The outer walls began to sway, and the crowd,
which had surged up as near to the scene as the
ropes would permit, gave way in momentary ex-
pectation that the walls would fall out-
ward, Instead of this the rear wall of
the theater fell first, crashing inward with a
mighty noise and burying itself in the burning de-
bris. A shower of sparks arose and this a moment
later was increased ten-fold as the wall on Johnson-
st. tottered and fell inward also. A suppressed mur-
mur of admiration went up from the crowd at the
brilliancy and impressive character of the scene.
The fire now seemed to burn with added fierceness,
and those who were watching the flames from a
distance thought that a new building had
caught fire, Those near at hand, however, saw with
gladness that the fury of the flames was spent. The
dwelling structure adjoining the theater was now
enveloped in flames, and soon nothing but the un-
sightly walls were to be seen rising amid
the roaring sea of fire, The heat on
Johnson-st. at this time was so intense,
and the streams of water which crossed each
other from several points made the place untenable
to all who were not guarded with tarpaulin and
waterproof clothing, Washmgton-st. looked like a
section of the Erie Canal when a break has
occurred. Mud and water in about equal pro-
portions filled the street, and the constantly-moving
crowd sopn rendered this thoroughfare almost im-
passible, Johnson-st. was choked with the frag-
ments of the falling wall, and great sheets of tin
from the roof and gutters.
The appearance of the crowds was quite singular.
There was a large number of ladies present, the
majority of whom had been in the theater
at the time of the accident, and who
had not yet recovered from the fright of the
unexpocted catastrophe, They now moved rest-
lessly about, attended by their escorts, and added
in no small degree to the difficulty of thread-
ing one’s way in and out of the multitudes
from one portion of the fire to another. The
“rough” element was out in full force,
although it was much less demonstrative
than usual on occasions like this, when so much
opportunity is afforded to give loose rein to lawless
instincts. The motley throngs were very peaceful,
and the police regulations were stringently enforced.
Travel was delayed on the Fulton-st. car lines,
owing to the stretching of the Lose across the street
in several places,
A full *hour after the fire began the sky was still
brightly illuminated, and the host of people in the
streets was receiving constant accessions both from
Brooklyn and this city, The fire still burned
brightly although the greater part of
the contents of the theater building was
consumed, On account of the thick fire-
Wall Dieter's restaurant was little injured by fire
The Argus building suffered still less. Both build-
ings, however, were deluged with water,
The total loss on the Brooklyn Theater, owned by
the Brook!yn Building Company, is $180,000. Itis
insured for £40,000 in various companies. The prop-
erties and a portion of the scenes, owned by Shook
Pahner, were valued at $20,000, The loss on
actors’ and actresses’ wardrobes is $3,000. The
wooden and brick building adjoining the theater on
Johnson-st. was damaged £5,000, Six houses
on Johnson-st,, opposite the theater, were
badly scorched in front, the damage not exceeding
$3,000, Dietur’s buildmg was damaged $5,000 by
water. The rear of the Post-Office and police station
were damaged $2,000, A shed on the opposite side of
Theater-alley, containing lumber, was damaged
$5,000, Several houses were scorched and had
windows broken, the general aggregate of this loss
not exceeding $1,000,

THE INJURED AND MISSING,
Although the main part of those present in the
theater were able to escape, yet it is known that
three persons were jured and others are miss-
ing. John Cumberson, a scene-shifter employed
at tho theater, was severely burned about the
face and neck, and 1n making his exit had his feet
injured by some one jumping on them, Frederick
Voss, whose father keeps a jewelry store in
Columbia-st., had his hands and face burned,
A boy named Lynch, who was found in
an unconscious condition and remained in-
sensible until an early hour this morning, was
recognized by a friend. He was in the gallery, and
it is believed he jumped or fell in such a way
as to injure his brain, The attending physi-
cian believes concussion has taken place. There
Three persons were taken to the hospital at the
Long Island College, at Pacific and Henry-sts., and
medical attendance was given them. Several
persons called at late hours io learn if
their missing friends were there, but only
one succeeded in finding what he sought.
One person said four people were missing from
his house. Mrs. Farrall of No. 145 Myrtle-ave.
called early this morning and said her son
George had mot been seen since the fire.
H. 8S. Murdoch, who took the part of Pierre
in the play, and who boarded at No. 53 Concord-st.,
had not been seen and fears for ls safety were felt.
His home is in Boston. Several persons who were
in the family cirele with friends lost them in the
confusion of leaving and have not been able since to
find out where they are,

The fire in Brooklyn theater last nicbt

I', is thought that not less than 100 per
sons were killed in the msh to the exit

formance of the last scene of the Two
Orphass, in which Mies Claxton was

no possible way of escape except by

terror, confusion and distress ensued

The polics from the station house, nex t

owing to the manner in which the peo
ple were piled up on top of each other
and massed together, they could extri

all bruised, bleeding and maimed.
The firemen got to work on the ruin

They succeaded in getting as far as le

Kate Claxton, at the preliminary ex

Erooklys, December 6, 12 m. The
number of bodies thas far recovered from
the ruins is about seventy-five, and it is
believed that as many more are still in
the ruins. They are mostly those of the
occupants of the family circle.
The Brooklyn Eagle famishes the fol
lowing in advance of publication: "The
work ol identifying the dead will be diffi
cult for most of them are burned beyond
recognition. The only mode of identify
ing will be by personal property found
attached to the bodies. Thus far it is
only evideat that tbeflunes made com
mon havoc with men, women and chil
dren."
Shortly bafore 9 o'clock llev. Father
Hanley visited the theater and amone
tne bodies recognized the brother of
Rv. Father Kylie. Father Kylie was
present and recognized the body of his
brother. The body was taken from ihs
rains charred and blackened almost be
yond recognition. In the breast pocket
of his coat were a number cf cards hear
ing the name "Abraham Barnett
in
German text.
The bodies are constantly being re
moved from the ruins and ari taken to
the morgue as fast as possible.
It is rumored that a nnmbar of at
taches of the theater are burned.- It
seems certain that Charles Lott and his
son, who were stationed in the upper
gallery, are among the lost.
The actors aod actresses esciped from
the stage iu'o Johnson street.
J. W. Thorp, the stage manager, savs
the fire occurred, in this wise: A drop
was ignited from a border licht by
some means inexplicable, as one was
guarded from ihe other. He immedi
ately directod stage carpenter Weaver
and two supernumeraries to endeavor to
extinguish the flme, bht the difficulty
wis to reach the part on fire. The stage
carpenter, with the supernumeraries,
essayed to effect the object by lowering
a drop and in so doing added fuel to the
fl iraes. The scene, the last in the play,
embraced a ceiled apartment, and the
instant the burning drop came in ou
tlet with the inflammable ceiling reivrd
Uepreidthe existing flames in a flash
as thoueb powder hai previously been
scattered about. The scenery and the
entire properties were iu a blazi. The
usual avenues of escape were thus sum
marily closed at the rear, and an exit, if
at all possible, had to be raide by way
ef the box entrance. All, except Der-
Lhapjotie or two, thus escaped. It is
now believed that ths number of dead
will be about one hundred and tweotv-
fiTB.
The courts adjoumel this morning
without transacting any business. There
is intense excitement in the city, and
business is partially suspended. The
Pe.rk Theater has besn closed for the
week. A meeting of the theatrical pro
fessioo has been called for Thursday to
concert measures for relief. Hon. Henry
C. Murphy, a distinguished citizen of
Brooklyn and well-known throughout the
country, is among the missing.
Wagon-loads of rouyh boxes are ar
riving iu front of the theater and corpses
are placed in them and covered with
tarpaulin and carried to the morgue.
The tcece grows more terrible every
minute. Men and women are crowding
the station-house and theater entrance
making inquiry fjr missing friends. Iu
some instaucos whuls families have
perished. The bodies present every
form of contortion, just as they stiffened
in the last agony, when the floor gave
way and they plunged down in the blind
ing smoke and flames; arms and legs are
bent and twisted ia every way, hands are
clenched aud reach out as if grasping
for help.
The Post says that about 11 o'clock a
horrible discovery was made. In the
middle of what was the lobby of the
thet'er lay an immense pile of rubbish,
smoldering beams, fragments of gridtrs
and other things. This heap was nearly
opposite the principal entrance to the
audjlory of the theater. Beyond it was
another heap, marking the place where
the stairs which led to the gallery fell
uuuer me neap brtt mentioned a
dead body was found; and the
Grtrnen diligently prosecuted their
search in this direction. With much
labor some of the heaviest lumber was
removed and a horrible Bight was re
veiiled beneath. Corpses lay in rows
heaped one upon the other packed to
gether with fearful solidity, which told
of the great pressure to which they hnd
bsen subjected. How many lay there,
what their sex or age, no man could tell,
and at noon only guesses conld be made.
Another actor, Claude Burroughs, is
now reported missing.

Women shrieked, struggled and faint

tered to the winds in cinders, and the
times, in a bright, mighty mass dancing
high in the air, preeented a terrible
spectacle.
Up to noon, eighty-seven dead bodies
had been recovered from the ruins. The
supposttiou now is that two hundred
persons wore killed.
Up to 8:30 o'clock this afternoon one
hundred and eighty-two bodies have
been taken from the ruins, and it is esti
mated that no less than one hundred
remain there yet.</text>

BROOKLYN FILLED WITH SORROW,
The Brooklyn Theater which was burned on
Tuesday evenmg was a total loss. Contrary
to hopes entertained at the hour at which
Tie TrIBUNE went to press yesterday moru-
ing, the sacrifice of life was terrible. Three
hundred people miserably perished in the
smoke and flames. The large majority of
them were young men and boyg; only a few
women and children suffered death so
far as known. Most of those lost were occu-
pants of the gallery, or third tier of the
theater. In descending the stairway they were
met on the second landing or second tier of
the theater by a blinding and suffocating vol-
ume of smoke, and fell in heaps on the stair-
way. This was broken down under their ac-
cumulated weight, and they were precipitated
upon the lobby on the first floor of the building.
The flooring of the lobby in turn gave way, and
the entire body of men thus entrapped by the
smoke in their pathway to the street, strangled
and blinded, fell victims to the flames. Of
those who occupied the dress circle (ground
floor) and the family circle (second tier), only
a few appear to have been lost. Two actors
were burned alive, three geene-shifters and
other assastants were seriously if not fatally
injured, and it is possible that several
supernumeraries on duty behind the scenes
perished. The greatest confusion and conster-
nation prevailed in Brooklyn, and full and ac-
curate detarls were not possibly obtainable. The
list of missing persons published below, it is
hoped and believed, contains many errors, in-
spired by the fears and anxieties of friends
of those supposed to be lost, who re-
ported their names at the station-houses.
These errors future editions may correct; but
the evidence is indisputable that fully 300
persons have perished. The Brooklyn Morgue
was early overtaxed in affording space for the
corpses, and one of the unoccupied market
places was converted into a temporary morgue.
The scenes at both these places were heart-
rending at the place of the disaster itself the
excitement was intense from early morning to
midnight.

HOW THE DISASTER OCCURRED.
THE STAGE AND THE AUDIENCE WHEN THE FIRE
STARTED—DISPOSITION OF THE PEOPLE PRESENT
AND EFFECT OF THE ALARM UPON THEM —FLIGHT
OF ACTORS AND ACTRESSES,
Few people in New-York will fail to recognize the
scene set at the Brooklyn Theater on Tuesday night
by its name—"* The Boat-house” in the “Two Or-
phans”—for few have failed to see it, put as it was
there presented for the last time at the Umon
Square in New-York, To those who had never seen
it, it is sufficient to say that it was a scene enclosing
within canvass three sides of the stage, with a canopy
roof above, midway between the floor and the
flies” or roof of the stage. At the back were two
great doors, which at the climax of the story were
to be burst open by the police, coming to the rescue
of the blind orphan The scene occupied the
whole stage of the Brooklyn Theater. At the drop
of the curtain on the last act the stage is usually
crowded with 30 or 40 persons of all degrees of im-
portance in the play, aud of all qualities as actors in
the estimation of the theater-goers. At the eritical
moment of Tuesday night's real tragedy this scene
of the mimic drama was occupied by only four per-
sons—Miss Kate Claxton, who was playing Louise,
the blind girl; Mrs. Mary A. Farren, who appeared
and warn the andience of the danger,
MAD RUSH FOR SAVETY~—THE WOKK OF REMOV-
as Madame Frochard; J, B. Studley as Jacques, and H,
8. Murdoch as Pierre.
To this little gronp, first of all on the stage and in
its front, came the earliest intimation of impending
disaster. They beard but did not gee it, One of the
“flies” of the stage—the long streamers which cross
the stage, and represent either “sky” or ceiling,”
a8 occasion may require—was blown violently
against a gas jet, and quickly ignited. The men
aloft as quickly ent away the burning piece, and it
fell—alas! not to the stage, as they anticipated, but
upon the painted canvas roof of the *boat-
house,” and rapidly burned through, The
warning which had been heard in the
rostling of seenes was confined hy the
blazing of the scenery, Those on the staze had the
presence of mind to rush forward to the foorlights
They then
songht safety in fight. Miss Claxton and Mrs, Far-
ren escaped by an nnderground passage to the box-
office (H in the large diagram) Mr. Studley by other
means, but Mr. Murdoch, seeking his dressing-room
to save some valuables, perished, The large major-
ity of those on the stage waiting for their entrances
made rapid exits hy the rear doors, except two or
three seenc-shifters who heroically remained behind
to eid others, and suliered burns that may prove
fatal.

The large diagram of the theater is worth a whole
column of description, It shows, however, only one
floor or tier of the theater, known as the dress
circle? and parquet, and the lobby, the common
entrance for those occupying seats in the first and
second floors. Above this floor were two others,
the family eircle or second tier, and the gallery or
third tier. There were 250 on the first tier, 300 on
the second, and 405 on the upper floor. The only
way of egress from this last gallery was by
a winding and narrow stairway, shown
in the smaller diagram as the gallery stairs. The
persons in the lower tier were, of course, the first to
be warned, for the burning “fly” was visible from
below, while hidden fiom those above. Many
seeing] the flames rose in their seats and
would have fled bnt that the actors in their
warning to be cool lulled them momentarily
into a feeling of security. But soon fully aroused
to the danger, they rose precipitately and fled.
Most of those on the first tier, it is believed,
all, it is hoped, escaped; yet some may be found
buried under the mass of debris yet remaining to be
removed. Those in the second tier fled with like
precipitation, and probably nearly all escaped. But
those in the upper tier—chiefly young men and
boys, and probably nearly all poor persons—were
doomed to a terrible fate. Apparently—judging
from their position as found, from the appearance
of the debris which covered them, and from the
known location of the stairway leading to the gal-
lery—the frighgened four hundred must have
rushed in wildest confusion down the first
flight of stairs (on the right side of the
diagram) to the landing which crosses above the
lobby and vestibule, Here they were apparently—
it is all a theory which there are none to dispute or
confirm—met by the blinding smoke driven by the
wind from the part of the theater then burning, and
falling in heaps on the landing broke it down,
and all were precipitated headlong into the lobby.
The floor of this part of the building, unable to sus-
tain the shock and weight, gave way, and the human
mass was precipitated into the cellar ten feet below.
In this position, as indicated in the diagram, nearly
all of the bodies recovered were found.

THE PANIC IN THE THEATER.
ARRANGEMENT OF THE INTERIOR—TUE PLAY AND
THE SCENERY—SPREAD OF THE FIRE—THE RUSH
FOR THE DOORS.
The rains of the Brooklyn Theater stand near the
City Hall, with the main entrance on Washington-
st., and the stage front at right angles on Jobuson-
st. A hotel occupies the corner, the theater having
been built around it. The main features of the sita-
ation of the theater in relation to Washington and
Johnson-sta, are identical with those of the location
of the Park Theater in this city with relation to
Broadway and Twenty-second-st. The theater was
bounded on the north by Flood’s-alley, which is
parallel to Washington-st. The main entrance
gave access to the parquet, which was reached
from the lobby by three fly-doors at right angles to
the main entrance, There was a broad stairway in
the further end of the lobby by which people as-
cended to the dress circle, the first tier. Between
the stairway and the parquet there was a lobby door
for a critical emergency, opening in Flood’s Alley,
A private passage led from the lobby near the box-
office to the stage. There was a large and a small
stage door opening on Johnson-st. The gallery
(second tier) was reached by a stairway
entirely separate, with entrances on the
left of the main Washington-st, entrauce,
At the first landing the passage crossed
above the coiling of the lobby to the wall, aud by
another flight reached the gallery. This separate
passage was of fair width as compared with similar
means of exit in other theatres. The theater was
comparatively new, having been opened Oct, 2,
1871. It cost $120,000, and was deemed to be
fairly arranged and appointed, Shook Palmer of
the Union Square Theater have been its lessees,
The play of the Two Orphans” has been popu-
lar with the people of the two cities, especially with
young persons, It is not surprising that the Brook-
lyn Theater was completely filled in the cheaper
parts of the house on the second presentation of the
play in this revival. The parquet, however, was
only two-thirds full, and contained 250 men and
women. There were about 300 in the dress circle,
and between 400 and 450 in the gallery, a majority
of whom were young men between the ages of 18

1,000 and 1,100 persons,
never to go forth alive.
The night was beautiful and clear, the moon shone
bright, and all was still outside, except that car-
riages rumbled as they drew up near the entrance
in anticipation of a quiet termination of the play,
The curtain, which had just been rung up on the
last act, revealed a scene of exciting and pathetic
interest to the andience, It was the interior of the
hovel boat-ouse on the Seine. The blind Louise
Miss Claxton) lay on a bed of straw; on the left of
the stage was the half-attic room, reached by
a short stairway, to which Lowise was taken
by Madame [Irochard (Mrs, Tarren), while
Henriette (Maud Harrison) was knocking.
The lame JZierre (Mr. Murdoch) was there, and
Jacques Frochard (Mr, Studley) completed the per-
sonages of the scene, which was approaching a tur-
bulent climax. In afew moments more the play
would have been brought to the point wliere the
wide doors of the boat-house are burst open and a
crowd of soldiers and people rush in to overpower
the Frochards., It was well for the safety of these
that they were not there,
The roof of the boat-liouse, a canvas covering,
concealed the flies and drops of the stage fron the
actors and from the audience. About 11:20 o'clock,
what is called the ‘moonlight cut-wood drops”
took fire from the recond border light, a row of gas
jets stretching across and above and illuminating
the middle part of the stage space, The fire was
trifling when discovered by the stage carpenter, A
drop-shifter went out'in the groove to extinguish it,
but only served to communicate fire to the adjacent
drops. Then, as is usnal, the ignited drop was cut
away, but the men did not think that it was to fall
upon the scenes below, the canvas roof of the boat-
house, which immediately ignited, and sent the
flames flying to the left wings.
The tumnlt that ensued as the stage employés
strove to put out the fire on the boat-house roof
with poles conveyed to the audience ifs first warn-
ing of danger. Whether the fire was first discerned
by the audience or by the actors in the scene, the
conduct of the latter was cqually self-possessed and
heroic.
Sparks were seen by the audience to drop from the
roof of the hovel to the stage. Men rose in sudden
fright, Somebody in the lobby, possiby a stage em-
ployé who had come by the secret passage from the
stage, cried Fire! fire!” and raised the alarm, The
actors, who had kept on in their dialogue till now,
besourht the andience with earnest words of assur-
ance to be seated, to think the fire was used in the
play. Some took their seats, while others hastened
to the doors, and the brave actors and actresses
made the semblance of continuing, when a part of
the roof fell, showing their imminent pen, Mr,
Murdoch and Mr. Strudley called to the audience to
be orderly and save themselves,
The people stood for an instant dazed gnd spell-
bound, as the scenery fell, and revealed a fire-en-
veloped stage. Another instant and they were seized
with frantic terror and rushed for the doors. Miss
Claxton, Miss Mande Harrison, and Mrs, Farren ran
through the private passage to the lobby, and
reached the wain entrance before the andience was
fairly started, Other actors and the stage attend-
ants went the same way, and through the small
stage door and a window looking into the alley. Mr.
Murdoch and Claude Burroughs, who had left
Maude Harrison in the green room, ran to their
dressing-rooms, it is supposed, hoping to save their
stage wardrobes. A descending scene-shifter cried
to them, Go back,” and barely escaped with his
life. They had no time to follow, Before the John-
son-st. wall fell the firemen thought they saw a
body in the flames below the place where Mr, Mur-
doch’s dressing-room had stood.
The indescribable panic among the audience
lasted possibly ten minutes. Confusion followed
on confusion, Thomas Rochford, the head usher,
thought of the doors opening on the alley, The one
in the lobby he succeeded in opening. It was a gate
of deliverance to many. A few gallant men en-
deavored to quell the panic, but human eflort was
vain. In less than a minute the passages were
choked up, the theater was filled with shouts of
maddened men and the piteous and frantic screams
of women. Men forgot that they were trampling
on their fellows, and, indifferent to all but their
own safety, scrambled upward and outward. Hus-
band became separated from wife or child and
friend from friend. The parquet was quickly emp-
tied of all save those few who must have been
trampled down and suffocated near the lobby,
The fire had spread with astonishing rapidity
from the proscenium to the ceiling of the dome, and
the black smoke, drawn by a draft like.a steady
wind, rolled in uporr the galleries and added another
terror to the gasping men and women who, still free
from the jam on the stairway, dropped to the par-
quet floor to perish in the heat and smoke, There
was great peril and loss of life on the Jobby stairs
leading to the dress circle, The stream of people
flowed on swiftly, crushing some, carrying others
out on shoulders from the dress circle until a stout
lady caught her foot at the landing in the stair-rail
and fell. The way was blocked. Crushed and
maimed men wera piled one above the other. Three
policemen, one of them stripping off his coat, extri-
cated the lady and opened the way again. Those
who could extricate themselves ran over a mass of
prostrate beings to the door.
The gallery was filled by young men and boys.
The means of egress were by a separate, angular
stairway. Here the panic was worst. A fow got
out in the first rush, A jam occurred at the second
landing above the lobby, and the staircase was bar-
ricaded by an inextricable mass. Some jumped
over the stair-rail, others dropped into the parquet,
Before those not killed outright and those
behind could free themselves the stairs gave
way and all fell into the lobby, which
in turn went down, It wus a headlong fall, the
crushed and bleeding men and women and boys
bound and wound into a solid mass, were suffocated
by the weight and the smoke, Those who escaped
this awful death, bruised and maimed, and with
clothing torn, scarcely knowing .how they came
forth, all thought that nobody was left to perish.
Even in all the outside confusion which ensued, it is
surprising that the loss of a single human life was
discredited and not definitely known till almost
three hours after the fire broke out. The excitement
was intensified from morning till night of yesterday
as the magnitude of the calamity enforced itself
by the bitter evidence on men’s minds, The scenes
at the Morgue and the old market where the char
red remains were taken were terrible. By night-
fall it was believed that more than a handred
bodies were yet to be exhumed. The work was con-
tinued by the light of torches and lanterns, It was
brought ont in the examination, instituted by Fire
Marshal Keady, that there were no facilitics on the
stage for quenching fire,

FATE OF TWO ACTORS,
THE DEATH OF CLAUDE BURROUGHS AND H, 8,
v MURDOCH.
From the fact that the fire originated on the stage,
1t might have been thoneht that the los of hfe
among the members of the theatrical comp iny would
have been great. Such was not the case, however
only two lives were lost—those of Maude Barronghs
and Henry 8. Murdoch. They played rospectively
the paris of Pierre, the cripple, and Picard, valet to
the Chevaiier. At the moment that the fire was dis-
covered Mr. Murdoch was on the stage with Miss
Claxton, and Mr. Burroughs was waiting for his
cue to go on.
_ When the alarm was given, both Mr. Mardochand
Mr. Burroughs ran to their respective dressing-rooms
to get clothes to wear in the street, their garmeuts
being very scanty in the play. Their dressing-roons
were on the same side of the stage and the right
wing, as viewed from the auditorium, and oouse-
quently furthest from the stage door, even had that
means of departure not been locked. The dressing-
rooms were arranged in tiers, approached by a nar-
row stairway, which was continued until it reached
the painter's bridge, which spans the alage
pear the tep of the building. Mr. Murdoch’s
room was on the second tier and the one occupied by
Mr. Barroughs’s was on the third, directly over that
occupied by Mr. Murdoch. It is known that hoth of
the gentlemen rushed for their dressing-rooms and
gathered up their clothing, and they were seen
making an effort to descend together. It had been
only the work of a moment to accomplish this, nt
before they could descend the firé Lad wrapped the
staircase in o sheet of flame. All chance of retreat
cut off, the nnfortunate men were driven back step
by step until, driven to desperation, they ascended
to the trembling bridge, hoping that some last
chance of escape might offer in a descent from the
other side. But there wasnone. Once on the bridge
their position was hopeless. Hero they were last
geen by J. B. Stadley, 8s member of the company,
who was able to make his escape. It is stated that
Miss Claxton caught Mr. Mardock by the wrist and
urged him to escape and save Lis life, but he said
80, that he wanted to go up to lis dressing-room and

get his coat. A number of their friends in their pro-
fession were on the ground carly yesterday morning,
making inquiries for them, and more than one ex-
pressed great sorrow for their fate. They were uni-
versal favorites with their fellow-actors with
all who knew thom.
Mr. Murdoch had been only a short time before the
New-York public. He was about 34 years of age,
and a nephew of James E. Murdoch, the light
comedian. He first appeared in Philadelphia when
he was abont 16 years old as a general utility man.
From there he went to Boston, and thence to the
National Theater in Washington, where he sustained
juvenile characters during the ns of 1866-7
and 1867-8. He then acted in Brooklyn, Philadel-
phia, and Boston, appearing in the latter eity first
at the Boston Theater, and afterward at the Globe,
sustaining the leading male characters. He ap-
peared 1m New-York last Fall in the character of
Sandy Morton, in Bret Harte’s play of The Two
Men of Sandy Bar.” He was a very pleasant and
genial man, and unmarned.
Mr. Burronghs had been well known to the thea-
ter-going public of New-York and Brooklyn for a
number of years, and was an intelligent, careful,
and ambitious young actor. Nearly ten years ago
he was light comedian at the Brooklyn Theater
under Mr: Conway’s management. He had been
connected with the company at the Union Square
Theater since it@ opening under the management of
Messra. Shook and Palmer. He played one of the
reporters in Agnes,” the first piece which was pro-
duced there, and has been cast in almost every
been acted there sinee. The
when he has mot been
employed there he has been engaged at the
Brooklyn Theater. He played the fop in a number
of pieces, among them John Broughan’s Atherly
Court,” “Jane Eyre,” Led Asiray,” Maxie in
Ferreol,” and other characters of the same stamp.
One of his Dest representations was that 1albot
Champneys m Our Boys.” Mr. Burroughs was an
enthusiast in his profession avd a careful student,
and since he joined the Union Square Theater has
risen rapidly in the estimation of the public, with
whom he has always been a favorite, He was to
have been married soon to a young lady in this city.
His father and mother reside at Larchmont Manor.
A few mimmtes before midnight the workmen en-
gaged in searching in the ruins near the dressing-
rooms found the bodies of both Murdoch and Bur-
rougls.

SEARCHING FOR THE DEAD.
THE HORRIBLE DEVELOPMENTS AFTER FNDING THE
FIRST BODY—THE VICTIM? FOUND IN HEAPS,
THE POSITIONS SHOWING THE AGONY OF THEIR
LAST MOMENTS,
Early yesterday morning, when the fire had been
go far subdued that firemen were able to enter the
vestibule of the Brooklyn Theater, {he body of a
well-dressed lady was found near the box-oiiice, It
was standing, reclining against the wall, as if the
unfortunate victim had there beeu overcome with
smoke while pressing toward the onter door. The
body was removed to the Morgue, and careful search
was made for others who might have shared a
qimilar (ate. Up to this time it was nol known that
any had perislied in the burning building, and few
persons had called at the police stations to inquire
for missing friends.
It was not long before a ghastly heap of corpses
was discovered in the cellar, nnderneath the vesti-
bule, and the work of exlimmation was begun and
continued without intermission throughout the day
and evening. The news that there had been a Leavy
loss of life spread rapidly through the city, and
every undertaker in Brooklyn sent wagons and as-
stants to aid in removing the dead, Boxes were
passed down throngh the floor, the boedics were
placed in them as fast as they could be tiken from
the Leap, a blanket was thiown ever each, the box
was carefully raised te the sidewalls, placed in a
waeon, and driven away.
Soon after the work of removal begun a TRIBUNE
reporter entered the theater by the private stair-
way, and passing through the treasnrer’s room,
looked from a window down upon the mass of vic-
tims. The window was directly at the head of the
stairway, down which the ocenpants of the family
circle would have passed if they had been able 10
reach it. The stairs were charred and weakened,
mt had not fallen; all the flooring of the vesiibules
of the three stories was gone, together with all the
interior of the auditorinm. There were three doors
leading from the family circle to the vestibale, hut
only one stairway leading from it to the street; this
was less than seven feet in width, an had a sharp
carve at the foot of the first flight. All the oe
cupants of the the npper gallery seem to have reached
the vestibule and pressed toward the stairs, down
which a few—it is not known Low many—escaped
The clouds of smoke pouring from the stage either
suffocated the rest so that they were unable to
gtrugele toward the open air, or the narrow door-
way became blocked so that they were uuabie t
escape, Whalever may have been the canse, a large
proportio Lof those on (hat floor were in the vestl-
bale when it gave way, and all were hurled ina
comnpingled mass into the cellar beneath, where
they were soon covered with burning timbers, and
burned and charred or blackened wiih smoke beyond
all semblance to humanity.
It was for a long time snpposed that the ocenpants
of the upper gallery were the only victims, aud that
all in the second gallery or dress circle were paved.
There is no evidence of this beyond the fact (hat the
exit from the second gallery was wider, and that es
thence was easier. Among the missing are
wony who would not have been likely to take seats
in the upper gallery; and rich jewelry, ope ra-glasses,
of the
cape
kid gloves, &e., found on many
bodies, are indications that they were in
a pore expensive part of the house,
f the people in the two galleries shar da com-
mon fate, their number cavnot be estimated even
approximately; it will be known only when, one by
one, the poor mutilated bodies have been taken from
their pyre. and the horrible aggresaie computed
with certainty. From whichever galiory they came,
they were precipitated upon nearly the sane spot,
and lay as they fell, the entire pile coveriug an area
of 15 by 35 feet. Evidently the flooring of the ves-
tibule, at the end nearest the stairway, had given
way when all were standing upon it, or alter 1t fell
those in the rear were pushed or pressed forward
into the &byss.
Looking down from above the sight was horrible
beyond deseription. Men, women, and children
were packed together as closely as possible, their
clothing burned from the bodies, and in many in-
stances the flesh from the bones; the limbs distorted
with agony or bent out of shape by the positions in
which they fell; the faces shockingly burned and
blackened and in between the bodies and covering
the whole, piles of civders and still smoking tim-
bers. Strong men looking on turned pale and faint,
and those who were compelied to perform the task
of removing the bodies had a look of horror on their
faces, and spoke the fuw words which were necessary
to be spoken with bated breath. Hour after hour
the work progressed, and every new horror gave
fresh evidence of the extent of the calamity which
had fallen upon Brooklyn. At first the number of
killed was estimated at 35, then ai 50, then at 150;
and then all waited until the whole truth should be
known, venturing no farther conjectures, As body
after body was extricated from the seething mass,
others were found buried beneath, and the sad
work continued, the end to be known only when the
ruins of the theater have been carefully examined
in detail.
Three additional bodies were recovered during the
evening. Two of these were fonnd in the cellar, un-
derneath the corridor, and were ovidently the re-
mains of boys who were in the gallery. Further
search in the debris nnder the corridor resulted in
the finding of no more bodies in that part of the
building, and about 10 o'clock the wen were re-
lieved. A frosh force of men was set to work in the
vicinity of the stage and at the side of the main audi-
torium toward Flood’s-alley, with the purpose of
discovering the bodies of Murdoch and Burroughs,
the two .missing setors. In removing the falling
timbers of one of the dressing-rooms, near tle 2llev,
apart of a human body and a thigh were found,
charred beyond Lope of recognition.

REMOVING THE CORPSES.
ALL THE UNDERTAKERS' WAGONS IN BROOKLYN
INADEQUATE FOR CARRYING THEM AWAY
PROMPTLY—EXCITED CROWDS TARONGING TO
THE BCENE~THE GHASTLY BURDENS OF THR
WAGONS,
A dense crowd filled the streets in the vicinity of
the place of the disaster at an early hour yesterday
morning. A cordon of police was formed across
Washington-st. near its junction with Fulton-ave.,
and at its intersection with Johnson-et., but outside
of this line the multitude pressed closely one upon
another, striving to catch a glimpse of the ruins
and of the work which was in progress, Similar
throngs filled all the streets through which the vehi-
cles containing the remains were driven. The crowd
was 80 great that it was almost an impossibility for
those who were permitted to enter the lines to make
their way throngh it. All classes of people com-
posed the assemblage—women and children, as well
as men—all drawn to the spot by an excitement
which leveled all distinctions of age or sex. The
determination on the part of the people to see all
that was possible led them to resort to all sorts of
subterfuges to gain admission within the
limits, and only the excelleut police ar-
rangements kept them from encroach
ing upon the scene of the disaster and interfering
with those engaged in the labor of removing the
bodies. A gentleman who with several companions
was held fast in the midst of tho surging crowd,
powerless to move hand or foot, said: “We are in
much the same position as the poor wrelches who
perished last night, Only think how they must
have felt, knowing the flames were elose behind
them, while they were helplessly involved in the
mad rush for the stairway.” This suggestion was 80
shocking as to cause his hearers to shudder invol-
untarily. The sssemblage generally secmed to
realiza tho greatness of the ealamity, and a hush
unusual in sueh a large gathering held possession of
the people which was ouly broken by a low mur-
mer as the wagons with their loads passed throngh
on their way to the Morgue. Most of the buildings
apposite to the theater run through from street to
street, and the windows of all of them were crowded
with spectators, principally women. It became
necessary to station officers at the Washington-st.
entranee of each store to prevent the rush of people
throngh them upon the seene. One or two of the
Laildings having low roofs which commanded a
view of the scene were also cecupied by the anxious
crowd,
The appearance of the front of the theater was
much as usual, except that the glass windows in the
tower were broken and the doors were mach shat-
tered, dieter's restaurant was not materially in-
jnred and was open. The people who were allowed
to pass within the Jine were gathered in groups
abont the entrance to the theater through which the
Linlies were brought out. A temporary wooden in-
clined plane was bailé from the horrible pit in which
most of the bodies were found, and along this they
wore carried in boxes covered with blankets.
They were then placed in the undertakers’
wagons which were in waiting to carry them to
the Morzue. The wagons of all the wunder-
takers in Brooklyn were in use and were drawn np
in line along the edgo of the sidewalk. One after
another of them was backed up to the theater door
to receive the boxes containing the dead. At inter-
vals of a few minutes several men wonld emerge
from the door carrving a cotiin-shaped, leaden-hued
box, covered with a blankei to conceal the ghastly
spectacle presented by the charred and blackened
corpses. The blanket ontlined the deformed and
shapeless mass, A hand or a foot protraded above
the box, and in some cases the bodies were
stiffened in alinost a sitting posture, and as
the wagons were driven rapidly np the sireot
their heads nodded to and fro beneath the blankets,
or the protruding limbs quivered horribly. The
sicht caused wany stiong men to turn away from
the spot with tearful eyes,
The First Procinet Station-house was filled with
an anxious crowd of persons inquiring as to the fate
of friends, and with officers, reporters, aud those en-
vaged in the sad task of removing the dead, Be-
Lind the desk was a large pile of overcoats, hats,
and clothing of various Kinds, picked up by ofiicers
about the scene of the disastor,

Meantime tho crowds in the streets were eontinn-
ly augmented by men returning from business in
New-York, and toward 5 o'clock movement became
diflientt in any of the streets jead:ng to the scene of
the contlogration, As the magnitude of the calamity
became known, it seemed to cast a pall over the
in whispers, A young man

Meliwen of the Central Oftice Squad, who was on
duty in the gallery of ihe theater, He was horned
bhoayond recoguition but the body was identified by
lus elub, and it was taken into the First Precinct
Pohee Station and placed in the yard. Police In-
spector George A. Waddy, who was on duty at the
theater yesterday, said to a reporter: We began
work about half-past three this morning, and the
first body that we discovered was that of a woman
who had ecanght on a projecting portion of the
burned flooring and was «till hanging with a death
grip. Judging from the positions of the boaies 1
think they were precipitated into the cellar bead
first, most of them are found head downward.
They lie in the pit in rows in that position. J think
many of the people must have been suffocated before
the flooring gave way, as it only takes a very little
hot smoke to asphyxiaste a person. At any rate, 1
think we should hope they were, as it would have
saved them much snfiering.”

THE BODIES AT THE MORGUE.
SCENTS ATIENDING THE ATTEMPTS TO RECOGNIZE
THE REMAINS—A CROWD OF ANXIOUS AND CU-
KIOUS SPECTATORS,
The scene at the Brooklyn Morgue at Willoughby
and Canton-sts., yesterday, was awful almost be-
yond description. The dead wagons kopt driving
up and depositing their loads unal over 76 charred
bodies had boen received and it was announced that
the place was fail and could contain no more, The
police, under Sergeant Brennan of the Fifth
and Sergeant Corr of the lYourth Precinct,
were posted at the front acd rear doors
wd throughout the building, Then the
waiting crowd, that hed swelled uutil the entire
street was blocked up, was allowed to pass through
the rooms, and view the corpses stretched upon the
floors, for the purpose of wdeutilication. All through
the day the crowd moved through this build-
ing in an ewlloss etream. Nevertheless, through
the eflicient police management, and the courtesy of
the keeper of the Morgue, Patrick Maguire, there
was no confusion, and ample time was given to
enable the friends to make thorough examinations
of the clothing and ornaments found upon the re-
mains, 80 that a large number were identified.
Many persons brought pieces of the garments of their
missing relatives by which to identily the bodies.
The authorities would allow no bodies to be
toushed, even by relatives; nothing was taken from
tho pockets of the dead. Nothing was to be seen on
the floor but biack and distorted corpses, resembling
figures cat from coal more than the bodics of what
were once human Leirgs. Most of the dead were
men, there being ouly live or six women. The only
way of recognizing most of the bodies was by
jewelry, the clothing being burnt so that the color
could not be ascertained. One man was identified
Ly his watch and cham, another by a gold neck
stud, &c.
One of the first that was positively identified was
P. H, Geary, 19 years of age, of No. 104 Presi-
dent-st. He wore upon his left breast a fine gold
badge of membership of the 69th Regiment of New-
York. This, however, was the only mark upon the
remains that conld have led to their identification.
Pvery part of his body was burned toa crisp and
his hair was singed oft’ close to his head, His eloth-
ing was burned and torn and his limbs were man-
gled by the falling bricks and mortar.
As one of the dead wagons, filled with the bodies
of the victims, was driven up to the Morgue, one of
the bodies immediately was recognized as that of
Nicholas Kieley of Red Hook, N. J. He was only 20
years of age, and wus a brother of Father Kieley, a
well-known Brooklyn priest. The young man was
on a visit to his brother, it was said, and decided to
visit the Brooklyn Theater to see the “Two Or-
phans.” Several saw him after the cry of fire had
been raised in the theater, and it was believed that
he had saved himself by early flight, It proved,
however, that he became entangled in the panic-
stricken mass,
Oue of the bodies that was nearly burned beyond
all resemblance of humanity was at length identi-
fied as that of John Turner of No. 126 Jay-st. Tur-
ner was a buteher, and the only support of a family
of seven persons. In his pockets was found $148,
whieh was handed over to Coroner Sims, J. P. Me-
Kinney of No. 67 Jay-st. and two young ladies
came to the Morgue and identified Turner, Me-
Kinney was in tho gallery in company with Taruer
and John Boyle when the theater took fire, Je
anid: The first that I heard of any trouble was a
confused noise in the rear of the gallery near the
doors. I was sitting in the front row and my whole
attention was absorbed by the play. Then be-
fore I conld see any fire I heard some-
body say, ‘the theater is on fire, Look out
for yourselves,” A moment afterward another per-
son cried, ‘Shut up; there 15 no fire.) Everybody
in the gallery had risen and was rushing for the
doors in a solid mass. The panic was so great that
men caught hold of those nearest them and stripped
their clothing from their backs. The pressure be-
came 80 great that it dul not seem as if there was
any avenue of escape for us. Tucner, Boyle and my self
drew ourselves up the side of the gallery and at
length suceceded in getting out into the passage-
way. As soon as 1 got into the crowd I did not need
to use any exertion at all. 1 was berne along by
the others who were pressing belnnd, and could not
eheck my rapid descent, even afier it becaine un-
pleasant. Boyleshouted, Where is Turner? ‘Oh, 1
am all right, exclaimed Turner in reply, ‘you go
ahead and save yourselves, Lam allright and will meet
you outside.” Ina moinent Boyle leaped upon the rail-
mg and dropped into the well-hole beside the stair-
way. 1 was carried down staivs safely and out into
the cpen air. 1 believed that Turuer bad saved him-
self, hut had afterward become separated froin ns
inthe crowd after wo got outside the theater, 1
was very much surprised to learn that Purner had
lost his Life. He was a gencrons, large-hearted
man, and must have gone back to attempt to save
some unfortunate person who called to him for Leip.
I cannot say whether the stairs fell in or not,
know that all in the gallery were not lalled, for there
were BO or 00 who escaped at the game time that
did. A portion of those who were in the famiiy cir-
cle reached the street, bat many were cut off from
their means of exit hy the crowd.”
Many women whose dacchters did not return to
their homes as was expected on Tuesday night,
visited the Morgue in the expectation that they
mieht have gone to the Brooklyn Theater and been
made victims of the disaster. Every female body
was examined, but none answered the descriptions,
and one after another hurried away to the un-
provised Morgue in Aday)s-st. Matilda Ward and
her husband, a young couple, each 22 or 23 years of
ngs, were both desir wed in the theater. They had
ocenpied seats in the family eirele and endeavored
to escape with the crowd when the alarm of {ire was

was taken to the Morgne, and late yesterday after-
noon was identified by her relatives by some peculiar
ornaments found upon her person. Her face was
charred and bummed beyond semblance of a hnman
being, and ome of her hands was reduced to ehareoal,
Richard Curran, 25 years of age, of No. 1206 Jay-
st., was one of those who haf gone early and secured
a front seat in the gallery. His escape was come
pletely cut off by the panic-stricken erowd, and at
last Lie was 2een to leap upon the railing and diop into
the parquet. His father is a lighter man, and the
son assisted him in that work, When the body of
the son was identified it was scen that his legs were
fractured, This probably was occasioned by Lis
leap into the parquet, Then, being crippled by the
fall, he was nnable to move,
A medical gentleman stated that the position of
nearly all the bodies dicated that a mighty strug-
gle was going on when death overtook them. Arms
were flexed and hands clenched and in the act of
pushing. Knees were bent and legs drawn up as
though lighting off some advancing, overpowering
foe. Whether this was caused by the pressure of
the crowd or the falling debris or even the heat of
the flames could not be told, It was the gen ral
opinion, nevertheless, that some portion of the
building gave way, precipitating the crowd into the
flames below. The rapid fall of the roof that fol-
lowed buried those who escaped the other catas-
trophe,
Among these who eae to identify the bodies wero
many colored people. The portion of the family
circle set apart for colored persons had been filled,
and from its gitnation few, if any, had been able to
escape. It was very difficult to distinguish the re-
mains of a white man from those of a colored person,
The lips and hair, if any had been left, were about
the only different features,
John Cozlett, 22 years of age, of No. 146 Prince-
st., also had been one of the occupants of the front
row of the gallery on the night of the fire, He fell a
vietun to the fury of the flames and the panie, and
Lis body was identified av the Morgue yesterday by
a peculiar gold ring that was worn on his finger,
His body was found in the heap with the others.
Many well-dressed gentlemen and ladies were seen
among the crowd that poured in a never-ending
stream throngh the Morgne from 10 a. m. until after
5 p.m, when it became toe dark to longer identify
any of the bodies, Among them wore many who
were looking for some trace of some of the members
of the family of Morris Solomon of No. 103 Boerum-
st. One gentloman, an intimate friend of that
family, said that on Tuesday night Morris Solomon,
Ins son Philip and his son's wife Lena, and his two
daughters Mary and Deborah, went to the Brooklyn
Theater together, They occupied seats in the family
cirele, and had considered themselves fortunate in
securing place well in front. No tidings had been
received from any of this party, and it is feaved that
they all have perished. Mr, Solomon wore a peen-
liar double-breasted vest, and there were ornaments
upon his person by which it 18 hoped that his body
if found can be identisied,
One of the visitors thought that he recognized one
of the bodies by a key-stone feund upon his watch-
chain, and believed that the remains were those of
a cigar dealer named Stettmeyer, The friends will
be informed of this fact, and further steps will be
taken in the direction of identification to-day.
A youug ‘man named Dietz was identified by his
sister and a friend, who, on discovering that it was
the body they wera in search of, were so overcome
that it was all the authorities couid do to keep
them from falling on and embracing the corpse.
The sister stood near it, erying and giving vent to
such exclamations as, “Poor Abe! Oh! if mother
can valy stand this blow!”
Th» body of one young man was discovered by
his sister, who, casting one glance at what was heft
of his coat, gave a ery of “My Tom!” and fell
fainting in the arms of her father and was carried
insensible to the street. It was afterward found
that this young man was the only support of his
mother and sister, his father being a drunkard, who
had not contributed toward supporting his family
for two or three years, The boy held good situa~
tion in some banking house in New-York, and was
on the eve of promotion.
One man was identified as an employé of the Our
Boys’ Publishing Company by a certificate in his
pocket. His wife identified him, and, falling on her
knoes, hugged and kissed his braised and Mlackened
limbs as though she would rather die than leave
bin.
One of the last to leave the Morgue was George
Otis, who was in search of his brother Charles, who
had been in business at No. 47 Exchange-place,
Now-York, who, when last seen alive, was starting
for the theater,
A
THE IMPROVISED MORGUE IN ADAMS-ST.
SCENES OF REPRESSED GRIEF-—A GHASTLY ARRAY,
HORRIFYING EVEN MEN ACCUSTOMED TO SUCH
SPECTACLES.
At half-past 12 yesterday the Morgue was filled
with the charred remains of the victims of the fire,
and Inspector Waddy ordered the old Brooklyn Mar-
ket, cn Adams-st., near Myrtle-ave., to be used as a
temporary morgue, and there the bodies wore taken
as fast as removed from the ruins of the theater.
Coroner Bimms assumed charge, and Capt. Campbell
had command of a squad of police. The crowd
abont the door and for a block in each direction was
dense bat quiet and subdued. Within there was
a strange quiet not a loud tone was heard, and the
order and system which porvaded the sad charnal-
house reflected the highest eredit on the executive
abilities of tho officers having eharge. The market
has been disused for some time, and the windows,
shattered by a gas explosion, bave uot been re-
glazed,
The floor was hastily swept, and the bodies, as
they were brought in by twos and threes, were
placed side by side m six long, ghastly rows. On
the clothing of each was pinned a number, and the
Coroner examined the pockets and clothing in order
to obtain means of identification, Whatever was
found on each body was placed in an envelope,
which was sealed and numbered. Few were ad-
mitted except oflicers and those seeking missing
friends. Theso passed sadly from body to body,
examining what remained of the clothing of each,
and striving to find some clew by which
to recognize those whom they sought.
The order and decorum of the scene affected even
theas sad mourners, and not a lond ery or lamenta-
tion was heard. It was almost heartrending to wit
ness the enforced calmness with which a wife
searched for her husband, a sister for her brother, or
a mother for her son. A brother and sister spent
hours secking the body of their father. They
passed down each line, the young man’s arm thrown
around Ins sister's waist, and” speaking only in
whispers. There were no tears, or if they rose to
the surface they were hastily wiped away.
There was work to do; weeping would
come with the morrow. Detective Loony searched
for a favorite brother. He should know him, he
said, by the ring belonging to his lately-deceased
wife, which he carried in the wateh-pocket of his
pantaloons. When the body was found the clothes
were burned nearly off, but the watch-pocket was
ancharred and the ring was found. Mr, Loony burst
into silent tears as he bent over the remains of
his brother, and was led away by his friends.
A widow inquired for her son, She said Le wore a
watch and chain belonging to bis father; she should
know him by that, Poor buy,” she said, he was
40 anxious to go to the theater last night, and
thought ho was going to have such a nice time.”
Stephen Cram had a gold watch and chain, and $90
were found in his pocket. A young colored boy had
in his pocket a ticket of membership in the Jerome
Hopkins Choral Society of the free schools,
As darkness came on candles were inserted in thick
slices of turnips and placed one on the upturned
breast of each poor remuant of humanity, The
coroner and ns attendants moved about with can-
dles in their hands, and candles were borne by those
seeking to identify their friends, The scene
was horribly picturesque beyond deserip-
tion, "and will never be forgotten by those
who witnessed it. Toward evening a woman
was brought in with two small children,
one of whom had been found elasped in her arms.
They were not identified, but their size and appear-
ance render it probable that they were the bodies of
Lena Parbel, a servant in the family of William
Haldroch, a printer, living at Fulton and Nassau-
«1%. who went to the theater with Emma and Dora,
children of her master. 1t was rumored last even-
ing that her father liad shot himself in his despair,
but the rumor was wot verified.
As the evening advancod the erowd in the bnild-
ine hecame mora dense, and there was less quiet.
soute bereaved women gave utterance to their sor-
row in loud cries and wailings, and strong men
sobbed in their agony of grief. All through the
night the work of identification continued, and it
will be many days before all the victims of the
saddest ealannty which ever befell an American city
are recognized and claimed by their friends, Some
will never be claimed, but will sleep in unknown
graves; while mourning friends will erect monu-
mental stones over empty sepulchers,
———O——
THE INJURED AT THE HOSPITAL.
Only two injured persons were taken to the Long
Island College Yiospital, at Pacific and Henry-sts,
A Trisusg roporter called at the hospital yesterday
afternoon for the purpose of inquiring into ther
condition, and, if possible, of seeing them, The
snperintendent said that their burns were severe
and they needed rest; he was unwilling to admit
the reporter, saying that many of the injured men’s
friends had been denied admission during the day.
He consented, however, finally that the reporter
should see the surviving victims of the great fire.
The first was the stage carpenter, Thomas Cumber-
son, who was badly burned and blackened about the
face and hands, He lay on hus left side with hiseyes
closed, but was able to give an intelligible account
of the fire. He was at work among the flies whon
the cutwood drop” caught fire. Whether a gas jet
was fanned by the wind, or whether tho fire orig-
mated in some other way, he could not state. The
flames spread so rapidly that he had barely time to
escape by leaping from the second-story window,
which was broken in his hasty exit. He fell
upon the pavement in the alley in the
rear of the theater, and was picked up in an
anconscions condition and conveyed to the
hospital. His limbs were not broken, although he
was badly bruised and his hair was completely
burned off. His injuries are considered severe, but
it is not thought that they will prove fatal. He
lived at No. 134 Prospeet-st., near Bridge-st.,
Brooklyn. He has been connected with theaters in
the capacity of a carpenter for 15 years or more,
and was for a long time in the employ of Mrs. F. B.
Conway.
The other patient was A. L. Froidevanx, a young
man 18 years ofgage, who was engaged in the jew-
olry basiness with his father at No. 257 Columbia-
st., near President-st., South Brooklyn. He visited
the theater on Tuesday night in company with his
sister, and they occupied seats in the second bal-
cony on the nght of the stage, about five seats from
the front. The first indications offfire that thoy ob-
served were some sparks among the scenes; soon
the flames broke out, and one of the actors shouted
that the theater was en fire, aud a rush was made
for the exit. Froidevanx was torn and bruised in
the struggle to escape, ond became unconscious. He
found himself at 12 o'clock in the Washington
Street 1olice Station, without knowing how he
come there. The ambulance took him to the hos-
pital, His face and hands were burned, but not
blackened, and he appeared quite comfortable. He
had no idea what became of his sister, but it is prob-
able that she perished in the theater, His father
called to see him during the day.

'DESOLATE HOMES,
A Trisuxe reporter learned yesterday morning
that threo members of a fawily living on the third
floor of No. 361 Fulton-st. had been lost, Ho went
to the house and was shown up three flights of staing
into a dark passage. As he walked up tothe doop
of the room that was used by the family for 4
kitchen, a young woman came running out with
arms extended and cried ont, Is that yon, Chris.
tian? Is that yon, Frank 1” On seeing that the face
waa that of a stranger, she eried out
“Oh, Sir, ean you tell me anything ahont Christian,
or Frank, or Georgo 7 They all went together last
mght to the theater and we have not seen them
sines, snd my father says they are burned up.” The
young woman proved to be Mrs. Veith. After Ler
agitation had subsided, she told the following
story My husband’s name is Christian Vuith,
He, in company with my brother, Frank
Offermann, and a yonng man who boards
here, named William Bennett, wen% to the
theater last night, and wo hive not
heard from them since. They work at Mr. Oswald's,
No. 244 Court-st. Father went there this morning,
and Mr. Oswald said they had not been there. As
they Lave never missed a working day in a year, we
can't-help thinking they are dead. My husband is
27 years old, and Frank and William are about 18
years old. They were in the family circle, for they
pever sat in any other part of the theater.”
The scene in the apartment was truly heartrend.
ing. Frank Offerman’s mother was walking up and
down the room, crying, “Oh! my sons, my sons™
Four little children, the oldest not 10 years old,
were crouched m one corner of the room, while Mrs,
Veith held the youngest in her ayms. As the family
relied for their support upon the wages of the three
young men, they will now be depoudent upon an old
grandfather, who is the janitor of the building in
which they live, and who probably receives his rent
free for keeping the building clean. Christian Veith
was said to have had on a large seal ring, with his
initials cut on the stone. The other two had neither.
watches nor jewelry on their persons, and it is sup
posed that their remains will be unrecognizable.

THE STORY THAT LYE-WITNESSES TELL.
FIRST INTIMATIONS OF DANGER—HIDDEN PROGRESS
OF THE FLAMES—CONDUCT OF THE ACTORS
THE SUDDEN PANIC—A STRUGGLE FOR LIFE.
From the hundred aceounts of Tuesday’s calamity,
detailed by those who were in the theater ‘when the
fire broke forth or by those who, from a securer
position without, watehed the escape of the fortunate
and noted the progress of the flames, it has been
found possible to make a conneeted and generally
consistent story. Early yesterday morning the ac-
counts were so conflicting that the greatest uncer-
tainty prevailed 2s to the origin and circumstances
of the conflagration, and persons sitting almost
sido by side in the theater held opposite convictions,
Reflection disproved to the minds of many their
earlier impressions, and last evening thers was a
general agreement upon the mam features of the
catastrophe. The following narrative is combined
from the statements of numerous eye-witness of the
tragic event:
A good-sized andience, of which a larger propor.
tion than usual was in the galleries, was witnessing
the play of “The Two Orphans” at the Brooklyn
Theater on Tuesday evening. The picece had pro.
grossed somewhat slowly through the first four acts,
and when the curtain went up for the last act, the
hour was so late that the performers continued the
representation with increased rapidity, At 11:10
o'clock persons sitting near the stage in the parquet
heard a crackling behind the scenes, as though some-
thing unusual were going on, and several called the
attention of their next neighbors to the noise,
It was regarded, bowever, as noting more
serious than the repairing of a curtain or the
arrangement of a scene, From this moment nntil
the flames appeared, many persons in proximity to
tho stage recall no suspicions sight or sound, bug
others aver that the first intimation of alarm beiind
the scenes was followed by loud aud confused talk
ing among the actors and employés, and that al.
though the play went forward, the persons on the
stage appearing undisturbed and the audience re-
maining quietly in ther seats, they apprehended
that something serions was occurring, Within two
or three minutes a thin smoke curled downward
through the flies, and almost immediately afterward
alight flame darted out where the smoke had ap-
peared,
Up to this time the audience had remained in ig-
norance of the approaching tragedy, but behind the
scenes there was excitement and alarm, From there
a part of one of the flics waa seen to fall into a bors
der ligiit and to immediately eateh fire. The stage
carpenter and his assistant went up to put it out,
but while the assistant was reaching out to grasp
tho tly, a drop-scene caught in the fecble flame and
blazed brightly out into the combustible material
which surrounded it. Actors and scene-ghifters now
endeavored to put out the firs or to pull down with
poles the burning scenery, and it was at this moment
that the audicuce saw from their scats
the smoke and flame. And still many per
sons to whom the stariling scenic efiects
of modern theaters were familiar believed
for a moment that they were witnessing only the imi.
tations of the stage. At this time Miss Claxton, Ms.
Farren, Mr, Murdoch, and Mr. Studley were the only
actors on the stage. As the flame darted from the
flies, and many of the audience rose anxiously te
their feet and uttered exclamations of alarm, Mr
Murdoch and Mr. Studley, advancing to the front of
the stage, endeavored to quiet the excitement, aad
Miss Claxton, almost at the same moment, crieds
“There's no danger; the flames are a part of the
play.” As she spoke, a bit of flaming canvass dropped
at her feet before the audience. In an instant, panic
had seized tho spectators, and amid the screams of
the terrified and the shouts of those who hoped to
presorve order, the crowd, suddenly stricken with
dread and horror, surged toward the doors,
A fow, whose presence of mind had not deserted
them, remained in their seats, believing that the
fire was less to be fearcd than the crush, and the
four actors in the scene still standing on the stage
called to the audience that there was time to escape.
But the instinct of self-preservation had overcome
reason, and the struggle for life became fierce and
uncontrollable. Even the promptings of affection
were forgotten, and men trampled their wives and
children under their feet, not realizing what they
did. The wonder is that so few of those who bad
been sitting in the parquet were killed or
injured, that so many over whom the crowd
pressed toward the doors, struggled again,
bruised and bleeding to their feet, and
eventually escaped. If the scene in the body of
the house was thus appalling, language is nade
quate to describe the horror of those in ths gal
leries, between whom and safety were narrow flights
of stairs, With the first alarm they rushed into the
narrow passage from which the stairs descended,
but, as the expericuces of yesterday prove, only
those whose seats were nearest the doors escaped.
About 400 persons were in the galleries, and while
nearly all of these blocked the staircases, the others
for whom there was no room, driven by their fea
and crazed by the increasing heat and the ap
proaching flames, crowded upon each other
into the narrow space. Those
quet bad nearly all escaped when the frail
staircases leading from the upper gallery gave way
f
and fel), carrying all with them to the floors bglow
which yielded to the enormous pressure and were
carried down ono after another into the
bencath the lobby. The top floor, from
which the i
upper staircase descended, robbed in part of its sup v
ports and weakened by the flames which now sur
pry
rounded it, orashed down upon the iY
victims below, barying them in its ruins. fi
It could not bo ascertained last evening that mom
than one person made his way over the heads of #8
crowd upon the gallery stairs—a lad who couldno¥
tell just how he escaped, but said that 38
did not even once touch the
his descent. ‘Those who escaped
were in many instances so overcome with
to fancy themselves dangerously
their homes and to
eral conviction of those who bad been ing, and of the crowd who at the first alarm had
gathered about it, that few lives had been lost, and,
in ignorance of the wretches still within the burn-
ing walls, their attention was directed to the pres-
ervation of surrounding property. The roof of
the theater was so completely destroyed that it did
pot fall in upon the floor as a whole, but was
geattered in small fragments within and withont
the walls. At midnight those who had watched the
progress of the flames saw that the rear wall on
Johnson-st. must fall, and soon afterward, wita a
resounding crash, it tumbled inward upon the audi-
teriwm, sending aloft a broad sheet of flame. During
all thie time the greatest uncertainty proveiled
among those separated in the struggle {for life “rom
their companions who bad been with them in the
theater. Anxious inquiry failed to show where and
how the multatude had escaped, and all night friends
were looking for each other in the streets and ad-
joining buildings. It was not even known who ef
the actors had been saved, and atone time it was
reported that several of them bad perished. Several
of the company gathered at a neighboring res-
taurant and related the manner of their escape.
Some made their way out through the theater to the
Washingtoni-st. entrance and others left the build-
ing by the door on Johnson-st.
Such, in brief, is the story of the disaster as made
up from the varying statements of those whe were
inthe theater. Many other incidents and explana-
tions were offered which might seem to contradict
this story in some of its particulars. One person
gitting in the orchestra aflirmed that there was no
unusual noise behind the scenes previous to the first
alarm, but that suddenly, without premonition, the
flames burst forth above the stage. Another cye-
witness, who occupied a seat in the dress
circle on the second floor, attempted to
escape by the Johusou-st. passage, but the
throng which had preceded him m that di-
rection shouted to those who were pressing
forward that the escape waa closed. He then re-
treated and made his wav back to thejmain entrance,
through which he passed out unharmed. Another
man, who was one of the last {o leave the parquet,
gaw a number of men dropping over the galleries to
the floors below. Ile is convinced that with the ex-
ceprion of these who thus escaped from the galleries,
barely a dozen of their occupants were saved. No
comment was more common yesterday than that
the acfors displayed the greatest self-control, and
that if théirinjunction to the audience to remain
quiet had been followed, far fewer Yives would have
been sacrificed. Said one of the ushers: “It
was the panic which eimsed the loss of life.
There was time for all to have escaped
if order and reason had heen preserved.”
In support of this view it was stated by a geutle-
man whe, with his wife, was sitting enly a few seats
from the frout, that they. remained quietly in their
seats until nearly all of those in the parquet had
forced their way out. On the other hand, man
who attempted in vain to make his way out from
the gallery by the regular pussage-way, and event-
uzlly escaped by dropping over the railing into the
parquet, asserted that many who sat near him must,
under any circumstances, have perished. Women
could vot make their way out as he did, and the
staircases were utterly inadequate as a means of
exit.
Few persons, however, felt inclined yesterday to
¢itribute blame to others. The pasic, though dis-
nstrous, was altogether natural. The theater, teo,
sad doubtless, it was said, been regarded by the
owners and lessees as well and safely built and ar-
mnged. One of the company said that any state-
ment that the scenery was faultily set up, and the
glage lights carelessly managed was altogether
false. The border lights, from ome of which the five
originated, were of the latest pattern and had been
regarded entirely safe. The strictest rules were
enforced with regard to smoking and indeed every
precaution was taken to avoid even the possibihty
of danger. After the fire caught in the scenery,
every effort was made to extinguish it without
creating alarm, and, in looking back, it was hard to
see what more could have been done.

INTERVIEWS WITiI MEMBERS OF THE
COMPANY.
STATEMENT OF MISS IDA VERNON.
A reporter of Tur TriBUNE called on Miss Ida
Vernon, at the Pierrepont House, at Montagne and
Hicks-sts., Brooklyn, yesterdry, and inquired in re-
gard to the incidents of ihe fire. Miss Vernon, who
was suffering from a severe cold caught by expo-
gure, snd was almost prostrated from excitement
and faticue, said she had finished her part in the
play, and had left the theater a few minutes before
the alarm of fire was given. Her residerve was at
No. 28 Johnuson-st., enly a short distance from the
theater, aud her brother waslying there very ill from
hemorrhage, from which he bad been snffering
since early on Sunday morning. Miss Vernon had
been watching constantly with her brother, and
was much worn. She leit the theater ic haste in
order to be at hie side, She had just completed her
arrangements for gitting with him during the night,
when she heard a shriek, Hastening to the win-
dow and drawing aside the curtain, she heard the
sound of breaking glass, and an instant later she
saw a man leap from one of the gallery windows of
the theater into the alley in the rear. Others were
apparently preparing to follow, but Mies
Vernon tnrmed from the window in horror,
her sole thought being to save her brother.
Nearly all the furniture in her house
was removed, but where it was taken she eonld not
state. A gentleman had called on her yesterday
morning, she said, who told her that a trunk bearing
Ler name and a quantity of other property Lad been
carried to his house in Johnson-st., and he would re-
tain the whole until Miss Veruon should have an
opportunity of identifying it. Miss Vernon's brother
was carried iu safety to the Pierrepont House, where
Le now remains. As he left his room in Johnsou-st.
he took in his hand a bird-cage containing bis sis
ters favorite canary, saying, 1 will save one life
at least.”
STATEMENT OF MISS KATE CLAXTON.
Miss Kate Claxton was quietly lunching in her
room at the Pierrepont” House in Brooklyn as a
TiIBUNE reporter was aunounced last evening. She
swilingly referred to the calls she had received dur-
jug the day wien the reporter announced his mission,
aud with a perplexed air inquired how she should
begin. In response to questions she said that at the
time the fire broke out she was reclining on a mat-
tress on the stage, at the opening of the first scene
of the last act of “'lue Two Orphans.” She was
Iviug without a pillow, face upward, with her eyes
closed, but learing tho confusion she partialiy
opened lier eyes, and could see, through the canvas
cover of the house remescnied on the stage, the
tlawnes above. The scene proceeded with the knowl-
edze oi the part of the actors that there was a fire
on the stage, bub all were hoping thal it would be
extinguished. The actors on the stage at the be-
ginning of the act were Miss Claxton and Mr. Mar-
doch; Mis. Farrea aud Mr. Stadley also took their
parts soon after, and the scene was about half
played when the scenery was seen to be in flames.
The people in the parquet also became alarmed at
the cunfusion on the stage and at the fire, which
was now plainly seen. The four actors ranged
themselves in a line across the stage, close to the
footlights, snd as far as possible from the flames wn
the rear. Mr. Studley begged the audience to be
Quiet, saying there was no cause for alarm. Miss

Claxton is of the opinion that, had not the
tors remained firm in a line across the front of the
“stage, the people would have leaped upon the stage
88d attempted to escape by the rear where the
Sames wore raging. In a wowent or two, however,
“the alarm seized upon the people in the balcony and
&allery, and, a rush being made for the door, a panic
wed. Mrs. Farren wae the first to leave the
in ames and his retreat cut off. Mr. Burroughs’s
sad fate is supposed to have been brought about in
the same way, while Mr. Studley, whose dressing-
room was underneath the stage, was so fortunate as
to escape. Miss Claxton called for Miss Maud Har-
rison, who was inthe green-room, and with Mrs.
Farren ran along the private passage to the stairway
leading to the box-office. The flames could be dis-
tinetly seen under the stage at this time, and the
smoke along the passage was almost stifling. For-
tunately, the heavy door at the head of the siair-
way had been left unfastened, and the ladies thus
made their exit into the main entrance passage,
where the eager crowd were struggling and jostling
one another in their efforts to escape. Miss Claxton
graphically described ber passage through the
throug. She was scveral times thrown upon her
knees and bruised, but by skillful efforts
she snccceded in making her way out
in safety. As she emerged from the door
she cast a single glance back into the theater. The
five had burst through it in a sheet of flame, and it
seemed like a grand transformation scene. Miss
Claxton spoke in high terms of the presence of mind
displayed by the ladies in the audience. It was the
first time, she said, that she had ever witnessed such
a scene, and ber coolness surprised her. Afterward,
thinking of the danger, she ielt herself a coward and
tremblod.
Miss Clax®n came to Brooklyn on Monday morn-
ing to fill a three weeks’ engagemeat, after which
she was to go to Washington. All ber trunks, except
one, were taken td the theater, and her property
was all destroyed. She was reluctant to speak of
the amonnt of her loss, but ber friends estimate it at
about £9,000.
MISE MAUD HARRISON'S STATEMENT.
Miss Maud Harrison, a member of the company,
who resides at No. 66 Livingston-st.,, Brooklyn,
made the following statement to a TRIBUNE reporter
yesterday: “Iwas in the green-room with Mr.
Claude Barroughs and Mr. Daly, when 1 beard a
scufile on the stage as though some persons were
disputing and struggling. It was about a qoarter
past 11, and I asked Mr. Burroughs to sce what tho
watter was. He left the room for that purpose, and
in a moment I started to go up the stairs to the
stage when 1 met Miss Claxton and Mrs, Farren,
Tho latter said There ia fire, and the {heater is
gone.” I saw that we eonld not get ont of the hack
entrance on account of the fire, and so we went
through the private passage leading from the foot of
the siuge stairs to the box-office. We got there as
the first of the audience were making their exit. 1
saw no distarbance whatever, Mr. Burroughs did
not come back to tell me the cause of the distoib-
ance. As we started through the passage I saw a
ghower of gparks come down through the trap in the
stage floor. I saw Mr. Murdoch just before the
ringing up of the curtain for the last act. Ie com-
plained of suffering from a severe pain in Lis gide,
cansed by picurisy, I think” Miss Harrison lost all
her stage dresses and clothing except a shawl
STATEMENT OF JONN MATIIEWS,
I was waiting in the green-room under the stage,
and several actors were there waiting with me, all
of ns ready to take our parts ina few minutes.
Some one— I think it was Maud Harrison—called
our attention to a singnlar noise overhead, which
somnded hike a peenliar shuiling of the feet. Wo
continued chatting for a few woments, when once
more the noise stopped our conversation. I said,
There must be a fight among the supernumeoera-
ries,” and we continued listening, Then there was
sudden and, as it now appears to me, an ominons
gilence. Somebody went and opened the door of the
green-roomn to get partienlars of the noise,
and the cry of “fire” at once reached
our ears. 1 immediately rushed out of the
green-room, saw a few sparks flying around, and
tried to get up ike stains, but could not, as the
smoke nearly suffocated me. I then remembered
that there was a little subterranean passage, which
had been built by Mme, Conway at the time she re-
sidad in the theater building. Thithier I went, mei
my colleagues, Phillips and Daly, and finally
reached the street,
NARRATIVE OF H. F. DALY.
Clande Durroughs, Miss Hairison, Mr, Mathews,
and myse!f wore seated in the greeu-room whea we
heard an unusual commotion on the stage. 1 said,
“Wo must be near the end of the play,” when Bur-
roughs said, No, that ean’t be, I have a long scene
before vou go on.” Miss Harrison sau, There
must be a fight on the stage.” During this conver-
sation Burroughs, who had rashed to the door, re-
turned and said, There is a fire.” T thought he
was joking—in fact, I did v's pay wuech heed to what
he said, but still for the woment the idea struek me
that something like canvas or paper might be burn-
ing, and I went to my dressing-room. When I opened
the door I saw a terrible fire raging. 1 seized
my clothes with all the haste imaginable, and then
looking up saw fire all around me. There was no
time for hesitation. I threw my overcoat over me,
then went up to the stage and ran out, Isaw noth-
ing of poor Murdoch. Crossing the slreet the first
one I met was my wife. You can well imagine bow
happy was at meeting her just then, She had
occupied a geat in the erchesira stalls and had been
told by an usher when the fire broke out to sit
down. Like a good school-gir! she did so, but finally
went around to the parquet circle, and #aw that
the audience did not comprehend the danger
they were in, She pushed on to the
lobby, and there she saw that the panic had full
sway, and that the people understood it was time to
leave the theater. In the rnsh that followed she
was driven right across the street to the very spot
where I so fortunately met her. It was singular
that about 11 o'clock, while Charles Thorne, Mrs.
Farren and myself were conversing in the green-
room, we talked of the denth of Yrederick Conway,
Mr. Thorne made the remark, saying, “Well, we
must all go that road one day,” and in less than 15
minntes afterward the entire building was in flames,
Thorne’s remark made a singular impression upon
me at the time. and his words were constantly in
my mind while I was rushing for my life from the
burning building.
CIHARLES R. THORNE'S EXPERIENCE.
About 11:15.0'clock on Tuesday night 1 was sit-
ting in my dressing-room, which fortunately hap-
pened to be on the stage and known as ihe “star”
room, aud was talking to my wife, ‘when one of the
chorus singers said, “Oh! look at this fire.” 1,
thinking she meant there was a fire ont the back
door or pear by, rose to follow her, when tomy
astonishment looked up in the fly 7 gallery and
saw a bunch of fire as large as a man’s band. One
of the fly 7 men was standing on the grooves, ahout
25 feet above the stage, Ww th a long pole in
Lis hands trying to rap oul the fire, which
was in one of the borders. Knowiiz as 1
do the peculiar construction of a theater, and know-
ing also the short time it takes for a fire to commu-
nicate to other borders close by, I rushed into my
dressing-room and told my wife to put ou her things
a8 soon us possible, as there was not a motient to be
lost. 1 gathered up a few articles of my wardrobe,
and as 1 wae passing from my room, being very close
to the tage, 1 heard Mr, Mardoch, who wus then
before the eurtain, say, Sit still, there's no dan-
ger” 1 replied to him, “There is danger. Get ont
of the theater as soon as possible.” He looked off at
me and said, “What? 1 replied, Get out of the
theater; there's no chance of saving it.” At that
moment a sheet of flame like a whirlwind passed be-
tween ns and separated hun entirely from my view.
I saw then that my only chance of safety, having
my wife with me, was to get to the back door. Ino
sooner reached it than asheet of flame came down
and burned my hat and feathers from my head, 1
gained the street in safety, where I found my car-
riage still waiting for me. In my exit I pushed
many who were transfixed at the scene out the door
ahead of me. Among theso was Mrs. Seymour, Miss
Cleves, and the chorus singers. As the driver was
taking the blankets from the horses, a large bay
window directly over the back door bust out with
a terrific crash, hike an explosion, and fell close be-
gide me. 1 said to the driver, No matter about the
blankets, drive off as fast as you can.” After driving
away from the fire a distance of two blocks, 1 ordered
the driver to stop, snd in wy stuge costume I returned
to the theater to see if I could
render any assistauce.
One look convinced me that it was beyond the
power of man to help any who were confined within
the walls of the burning building. Isaw from the
main entrance people were tumbling over one
another down the steps, and terrified at the sight, 1
returned to my caniage and was driven to New-
York. iB. STUDLEY'S NARROW ESCAPE.
J. B. Studley, who took the part of Jacques
Frocharéd, had a very narrow escape froin the theater.
He was sititing on a stool in the center of the stage,
when he detected the .fire overhead. He told the
andience there was no danger, and urged them to
keep their seats, When the audience began fo go
ont he went down to his dressing-room leisurely,
having no fear that the flames wonld spread so
rapidly as they did. He took his citizens clothes
and started to go out, when he saw that the fire was
all around him. He rushed through the passage un-
derneath the stage, and being unfamiliar with
the honmse, failed to find the exit at the
box office, by which Miss Claxton, Miss Har-
rison, and Mrs, Farren escaped. He found a window,
which he broke, and the stifling sensations caused
by the thick smoke of the passage were dispelled by
the fresh air. Bnt the window afiorded no means of
exit, as it was surronnded by Ligh walls. A number
of persons foilowed him, and turning he saw a door
knob. He burst throngh the door to which it was
attached, and knew ne more until he found himself
in thre steed. He attribntes his escape to the fact
that his dressing room was under the stage, while
Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Burronghe, who were lost, had
dressing rooms in the second story.
THE BRAVEST MAN AT THE FIRE.
The bravest man at the fire without an execption
was Charles B. Farley, the assistant engineer uf the
Fire Department, to whose able management and
energetic work it is due that the calamily was not
even more appalling. Shortly after the alann was
given, and before any of the engines arrived, he wis
at the theater. He exerted himself to the utmost to
qwet the people and have than leave in an orderly
way, «o that all might get out safe, Bit when the
andience, in their mad rush to escapo from the
flames, began to trample on one another, he cow=
manded them to keep hack so that he might save
those who had failen. Although the surging crowd
was loath to obey, vet bis commands were so
earnest that he kept them baek a safliciont time
to pick unaboul twenty persons who wonld otherwise
have been ernshed and killed, and carried them, com-
paratively nnhurt, into the adjoining station-honse,
After saving these people ha returned to the theater,
which was now enzeloped in flames. Men, women,
and children were thrown down and trampled upon,
but the brave fireman roshed in among the {rantie
crowd, at the imminent risk of his own life, and
pulled out a number of bodies, cut, bruised, and
hiceding., Those who witnessed his achions state
that he saved in this way the lives of at least forty
Persons.
After the greater part of the people had left the
building, he turned Lis attentions to extimginishing
the flames. With one of his assistants he repaired
to the top of Dieter's restanrant, where Le eounld
command the best view of the lames. He saw at
once the danger of the wall on Johuson-st., and
knew that if it fol} the intense heat would ignite
the frame buildings opposite, He then ordeied
Engines Nos. 5 7, and 8 to bave stieams in readi-
ness at Washington and Johnson-sts,, so that when
the wall fell they could protect these houses. The
wall fol, as he expected, with a great crash, and ro
intense was the heat that degpite the three power-
fal streams turned upon the buildings they canght
tire, but were speedily extingnished,

Mr. Farley eried out, Give us a stream up here or
we will be burned up.” Those who saw the falimg
of the wall declare that if the streains had not
been in readiness the whole Block opposite would
Lave been in (Lanes, the. spread of the fire would
have been inevitable, and the loss of 1ifs and prop-
erty almost incalculable. Mr. Farley remained at ihe
fire throughout the night and all day yest day, and
was still upon the scene ato lite hour last evening,
He was one of the first to discover the dead bodies,
and about daylight yesterday morning he began to
dig them ont, His heroie conduct was noticed by
many people, and throughout the day he wis ean-
stautly receiving letiers complimenting lis on Lis
brave actions, and many others who saw him pass

THE FEELING IN NEW-YORK THEATERS.
MANAGER A. M. PALMER'S STATEMENT -SCENES AT
THE UNION SQUARE AND OTHER THEATERS,
All was quiet in front of the Union Square Theater
last evening, The usual nuaber of play-goers came
to the main entrance, bat the solitary policeman
stationed outside stated theve would be no per-
formance, and pointed to a large placard draped
in wournmag, which was placed inside
the railing, and on which was inscribed in large
black letiers, “In consequence of the terriole dis-
aster at the Brooklyn Theater there will be no per-
formance at this honse this evening.” People gazed
with blank astonishment até the significant an-
nouncement, sighed, and retraced their steps in
silence. Few appeared to appreciate the extent of
the disaster, and when informed of the dreadful loss
of life all commended the decivion of the managers,
Messrs, Shook and Palmer, ‘0 closing their place of
amuseinent for the evening. Inside, along the
lobby, all. was sad and gloomy. Ushers, mu-
gicians, and actors stood mm groups together, dis-
enssing in subdned tones the events of the terrible
night, and all the hilarity eo characteristic of this
popalar resort was entirely absent. In the man-
ager's office A. M. Paliner, resting his head in his
hand, was leaning upon the table, overcome with
grief and emotion, He had just returned from the
iil-fated theater, and now dispatches from all parts
of the country were reaching him inquiring for miss-
ing friends and actors, The task of wnswering
some of them was a sad duty, and in
the hope of hearing still later and better
news in regard to some persons, he delayed answers
ing a few for a short time. Mr, Thorae, Mr. Ma-
thews, and Kate Claxton’s husband came in, They
all shook hagpds with Mr. Palmer, but no words
passed between them. In fact, their silence was
more eloquent than speech of their sympathy not
only for their own comrades but for the may grief-
stricken families of Brooklyn. It was with diili-
culty that Mr. Palmer conld find words to give lus
version of the catastrophe, but Le finally gave ii as
follows:
“he first intimation had of the fire in Brooklyn
was at 3:20 this mowing, but I had ro idea that any
lives were lost, ‘The horrible news reached me later
in the morning, when 1 at once went over to Brook-
lyn, where 1 also gave testimony before the Fire
Marshal. Our own loss is great, bat we do not care
for that the terrible Jory sustained by the people of

and in the canvas had been added, and we had au

fering be more strong than avoand the Union Square

people is terrible. Of course it is of no uss 10 say
now what might have Leen, but Tam satisfied that
the lives of both Murdoch and Burroughs might
have been saved if they had been less dagug. You
know sowe of the actors ave very reckless, and do
not filly appreciate danger from fire, Had Mardoch
obeyed the summons ef Thorne, when the latter cried
ont to him to follow him, telling him ti:ere was real

roughs, too, understand, even when he was already
lialf on his way to place of safely, went back to
iis dressing-room to get his wateh, presented to him
some two years ago by his friends and colleagues.
Had he not gone to that dressiug-roem, with the
flames already raging furiously around him, he too
might have been saved. Mr. Palmer then gave the

Messages of sympathy came pouring in rapidly
froin all parts of the country, and Mr, Palmer gave
them all bis proper attention. In reply to inquiries
he stated further that the usual performance of

The other theaters, with the exception of the
Olympie, gave their usual performances before
moderate andienees. A large number of aciors,
however, ealled throughout the evening at Ryan's
Union Place Hotel, next door to the Union Square
Theater, to congratulate Mr. Thorne, John Ma-
thews, and Mr, Daly, upon their narrow escape from
death, and to learn the latest particulars about the
fate of Burronghs and Murdoch, Poor Harry,” said
one of the actors present, “he was one of the most
talented young men on the stage—a splendid por-
trayer of charaeter.” This popular 1esort of actors
last evening was as silent as though filled with
mourners. Conversation was kept up by them until
a late hour, but it was in a subdued tone, and when
the gnestion was raised why other theaters had not
closed their doors, one of them smd, “Ob, it is beat
that we should not dwell too long upon this horror.”

A. M. PALMER'S STAT EMENT.
The testimony of A. M. Palmer, one of the lessees of
the theater, vas as follows: w I reside at No. 10 East
Now-York, and with Mr, shock leased
the brooklyn ‘Theater from Messrs. Kingsley and Keeney
of the Brookiyn Suilding Compauy for three years, I
was uot in Brooklyn last nizht (Tuesday), but came over
this morning on learning of tho fire. We had a stock of
socnery, properties, and sarpitire awouutiug in value
to about $20,000, all ot which is destroyed. Oa this wo
Lad #n insurance of only 5,000. Tho lighting ncchin-
ery of the building was titted up four or Hyg years uzo,
and wis of the most approved and modern pattern. We
spared no expense to make the theater perfectly safe.
We had just put inu new set of ropes on all the drops
and borders in order to make them peri etly secure. 1
did uot see the fire, aud cannot say how it originated, 1
only know that we employed the most care'ul and com-
petent persons we could get, and that we were very ex-

times the house wonld be emptied in five minutes.”
ADNER C. KEENEY’S TESTIMONY.
Abner C. Keeney testified as follows; “I live at Ne.
175 Cnmberiand-st., Brooklyn; Iam the treasurer of the
Brooklyn Building Association, which built and owned
the Brooklyn Theater. The butiding was erected in 1871,
and cost about $200,000; Mr. Thomas Jackson of Broad-
way, New-York, was the architect; he also built Wal-
luck’s Theater, the Albany Academy of Music, and the
Boston Theater, and was recommended to us as the best
avchitect in this country for the construction of theaters.
The work of building was under his cxelusive control,
asusted by myself, and it was done entirely by days’
work. Tue walls were from 16 to 20 inches thick, rest-
ing en concrete foundations, carried up solid, and
grouted’ throughout. The cross walls and supporting
colons were all eapped and bound together with stone,
to insure as much strength as possible. The timber wus
all sawed at our own will, the New-York and Brooklyn
Cawmill, a8 ordered hy the architect. 1t was all properly
seasoned and dried. The building was designed to seat
abent 1,600 comfortably, The means of egress were
carchully discussed by the members of the association, in
order that the theater might be made as safe as possible.
With that view the theater was built adjoining Flood's-
alley, a small street running {rom Myrtle-ave. to John-
gon-st., and three different means of exit, with large
capacity and double doors, were provided on that side of
the builng. These passages to Flood’s-alley led from the
vestibule opposite the main entrance, from the parquet
in the middle of the building, and also from the lower
part of the parquet next the stage. These passages were
abont 6 or 7 feet wide, and were connected with the
“second gallery as well as with the first floor or parquet.
The front was provided with a main cntrance
from Washington-st., leading to the parquet,
and also with o wide stairway to the dress circle on the
gocond floor. These stairs were about 12 feet wide and
led down futo the main vestibule. There were two pairs
of doors, a four-door and a two-door entrance from this
vestihule into the parquet. Desides this there wes a
geparate and distinct way of egress from the gallery into
Washington-st. This stairway was about 10 feet wide
tiroughout, and fn no case could this passage become
chalked up, as it ts exclagively for the use of those going
to or trom the gallery, and had no communication with
other parts of the house. There was still anather mode
of xit—a private entrance to the apartments occupied
by the stage manager, Mr. Thorpe, cver the vestibule,
The stage was provided with two sets of doors, one a
large set opening on Johnson-st., end the other opening
on the same street nearer to Washington-st, There was
a private passage from the stage centrauce to the main
entrance under the stage and parquet. We estimate our
lose on the building and fixtures at about $120,000; the
surance ia about $10,000.”
THE CHILF USITER'S ACCOUNT.
The chief usher, Thomas Roehford, made a statement
as follows: 1 live at No. 230 Washington-st., and was
ehief usher at the Brooklyn Theater, and was in the
builaing at 11:25 last nizint, when the tire broke oat. I
{iret saw it on the left-hand side of the stage on the fly;
I stood outside the orchestra door, and heard the ery of
“fire, rashed in, bot the people crowded ont, and 1
tried to auict them, and a number of them sat down
again, Mr. Studley and Mr, Murdoch made a similar re-
quest from the stage, Tthen thongh® it conld be put out,
There were about 1,200 persons in the louse, 300 of
whom wore in the orebestrz, and the balanee, about $00,
up stairs on the other two floors; there must have been
500 in the gallery, and these were mosily the persons
who could not get ont, There was one entrance only
from the gallery to Washington-at, The door from the
dress circle was not open; if 1t had been it would have
Locked up the passage-way and made latters worse. I
remained there until I was driven out by the tire. I
had then cleared the orchestra and the parguect out to
Flood's-alley in the rear. Iam pretty positive that there
was noone lost in either of those apartments, went to the
foot of the siairs of the dress cirele, but could go no
further. The erowd was then rushing down on the top
of each other, and several were trampled on. There were
20 officers there helping the people out. The stairs are
about six or eight feet wide on eoen fight, and recined to
give wople accommodation heretofore, The whole duf-
ticulty seemed to arise from the desire of the poople up
stairs to get out all at once. It takes usually about six
oF seven minutes to empty the house, From the time the
fire was first seen till the theater was enveloped in flames
was not over five mioutes, There were three available
pussngoes Inst night for the au fience and three for the
actors. We opened a passage door on lood’s-alley last
nieht, which is only opened in case of five, and had never
been used by an wudience before. It {6 had not been for
this tiere would have been 200 more ives lost. opened
that door, and I have the Koy in wy pocket now; it was
hung beside the door.”
S—
ACTION OF BROOKLYN AUTHORITIES.
MAYOR SCHROEDER RECOMMENDS THAT THE CITY
TAKE CHARGE OF 1HE UNKNOWN DEAD—COM-
MITILES FOR THAT PULPOSE APPOIN TED BY THE
ALDERMEN AND SUPERVISORS,
A special meeting of the Brooklyn Board of
Aldermen was called yesterday afternoon, at 4 o'clock,
to take some action appropriate to the sad occasion,
Nearly every member of the bourd was presout. Toe
President, John French, eailesi the meeting to order, and
the following communication of the Mayor was 1eceived
pad read
To the Honorable the Common Council, GENTLEMEN
I have called you together to-day to deliberaie und take
action concerning the tervible calamity which Las be-
faticn the peopie of this city in toe burnin. of the bBrook-
lyn neater last night. It is impossible at tui hour to
eetimats the number of human beings who have perished
iu the conflacration, thongh already over 160 have heen
exhumed. From sich observation as I have been able to
ake among the roius, 1 do not think the relatives and
friencs of the demd will be able 1 wany cases to fdentary
the bodies of tuose Whose loss, under clicumstances of
siteh hot “or, must be mourned with unequaled grief,
For th: 3 reason it seems 10 mo thaigarrangeincnts
should b made by the public authorities for the burial
of the ur cecognizd dead in a manner beeoming a Kind
and sympathetic Christian people. Lo this end a cour
mittee suould be at once appointe d, and our merchants
and tradespeople should eluse thelr stores on tue day of
tae funeral sud partieipate in the obsequies. If, in addi-
tion, it should transpire that many holues Lave been de-
prived of tuetr support by the loss of a father, brother,
of Sub, the aitention ol our churches and our chantuble
insticitions and wealthy eitizens shonid he provaptly
calied to the tact, in order that neitlier the reality nor che
apprehicusion of immediate want way be superadded to
au infliction in itself almost insnpportable. Hespect-
fully, F. A. ScHBOEDYER, Muyor.
Aldermgn Fisher presented the following resolutions:
Resolced, That a conunittee of nine be appointed to
take into concderution the duty incwnbent upon the
wanteipal aathorities in view of tae recent desteuction

trou raid cotumiilee and to take aeuon thereon,
Resolved, That said comuuittee be authorized to confer
upon this subject with other organizations, vitleial or
vLuor wise.

The board adjourned to meet this afternoon at 2
otelock., Directly afterward, the committee appointed

He stated that the principal work for thous to do was to
provide some weaus by whiea the bodies of those who
could net be identified, or whose friends were poor, might
be buried at the expense of the eity. It was said that
the clause of their charter providing for cmergencies
might be stretched a point and male to eover this case,
Al ull events, it was necessary that this work should be
done by the eity, and ali citizens Ww ald bear shew
ous in tke activn, This opinion was concurred in by sll
of tie committee, and Alderman Fisher appointed sub-
committeea to perform special duties. Ons commikiee,

TERRIBLE LOSS OF LIFE.
Tbe Brooklyn Theatre Burned to tbe

tbe "Two Orphans Frightfully
Appalling; Details Tbe Jtorgne
Overcrowded "With 'tbe Charred Re
mains. Niw York, Dec An extra ot a Brooklyn
paper says that on tbe breaking out ofthe fire la
the Brooklyn theatre (formerly Mrs. Conway's)
last night, Mr. J. B. Stndley, who played the part
of Jacques, made an effort to calm the excited
audience. Stepping to the footlights, he said:
"There's no trouble here; there'ls no fire. La
dles aad gentlemen, keep your seats." Many of
the auditors resumed their seats, but only for a
few seconds. The flames spread rapidly. Miss
Claxton.who was playing the part of Louise,
the blind girl, showed great self-possession, as
also did Mrs. Farren. They resolutely remained
upon the stage Until the scenery at the left was
completely licked up by the flames. Then the
company rushed out Into Johnson street la stage
costume, saving only the dresses they wore. Tne
excitement In the audience was manifested la a
stampede.
TUX PASIO BECAME OETERAL
before the actors left the stage, and a wild rush
was made for the doors; womea shrieked, strug
gled and fainted; men plunged over the seats and
fought their way to the door. The aisles were
blocked. The ushers made every effort to indueo
the terrified mob to retire in good order. Ia thl
they were seconded by the police officers In -tendance,
but all to no purpose. In two mlrxtes
tbe stage was one mass of flame; the heat was
Intense. Many who occupied seats nearest the
stage felt the scorching heat and sank txlpless to
the floor. A moment sufficed to singe their hair,
scorch their clothing and burn the flesh. A few
minutes later and they were dragged out or the
theatre In an Insensible condition by tbe police or
tbe First precinct. Some or the actors sprang
out into the auditorium ana trsc their chances in
thestruggle for an exit by sne Washington-street
or Flood-alley entrance. Mrs. Farren was
among this number.
several lives lost.
Several lives are undoubtedly lost. Several
women are believed to have been burned to a
crisp. The body or one was recovered shortly be
fore 3 o'clock this morning and sent to the hos
pital In an ambulance. Two or three of the em
ployees, who were engaged In the flies and shift
ing scenes, are said to have perished la the
flames. If every bit of scenery In the theatre
had been drenched la kerosene the fire could not
have spread more rapidly er furiously. Even
before the first fire engine had responded the

storv or the bead usher.
The head usher, who was standing In the lobby
near the centre orchestra, says on hearing the
alarm, and seeing that the flies over the stage on
the left were on fire, he opened the Flood-alley
entrance, and all who were in that part or the
house escaped in this way. He thea came la iront
again, and saw the occupants of the dress-circle
pouring down the staircase. They came down by
twenties; fell down, as It were. They trampled
on each other. There was not much outcry. Be
.got oa oae side to avoid the rush, and looked Into
tne house again. By this time all the orchestra
.performers had escaped, and the parquette and
parquctte circle was clear. Tbe stage was now
all la flames, and the fire was rapidly extending
over the orchestra into the body of the house. The
proscenium boxes on both sides were entirely
;one. The police removed a doien or twenty
adtcs who had been thrown down by the rushing
from the dress circle. Be thinks all were taken
out, In a few minutes more the flames would
have consumed them. Be'saw two men carried
.out from the stage. A TMltee ameer who wan an

powerless. The crush was appalling. Men
tram) ed on "the women, and big men rushed
wildly over the smaller ones. It took fully ten
minutes to empty the dress circle, bat It seemed
like an hour. Many men and women were In
jured, and tome of them were severely hurt.
Numbers of women fainted, and we were obliged
to carry them out. Fortunately there were few
children present. Thedraughtofalr through the
theatre was terrible.
MISS CLAZTOn'S account.
Miss Claxton testified before tho fire marshal
this morning that at the beginning of tbe last
act of the "Two Orphans," Just as the curtain
went up, she heard a rumbling noise on the stage,
and two minutes after she saw the flame. She
thinks it caught la the fUts. It Immediately en
veloped the stage. Mr. Stndley and Mr. ilur
dock were on the stage together, and Mrs. Farren
and mysolf.and efforts were made to quiet the
audience. She said to them: "Be quiet: we are
between you and the fire, the front doors are
open, and the passages are clear." The flames
were then sweeping down upon the four, and she
ran out and down Into the audience and escaped.
Mrs. Farren, Mr. Mnrdock and Mr. Stndley also
joined In the effort to quiet the audience. No fire
was used la the presentation ofthe play.
MR. STUDLEY'S. STATELIEST.
J. B. Stndley testified that he was oa the stage
at the time of the Are, but he was Ignorant or its
cause. Bis attention was directed to It by a res
tlreness among the people at the back or the
stage. Then he saw the flames over his head.
Bow he made his way out he does not remember.
He does not think that any or the actors are lost.
The audience was pretty well thinned out or the
lower part or the house when he left the stage,
which ce believes he was the last to leave.

THE ORIGIN OK THE FIRE,
it began on the stage. Tho business mana
ger Mr. Rogers, says that a. piece of the
canvass, out of which the trees, etc., are
made, was broken from its fastenintrs and
hung from the flies, immediately over one of
the bonier lights, near the center of the
stago. The canvass had begun to smoulder,
and tho paint on it to crackle, and the car
penter was directed to ascend to one of the
grooves and remove the dnngerous object,
lie could barely reach it with his hand, and
he drew it hastily up. The rapid motion
through the air of the half ignited and highly
inflammable canvass, caused it to burst into
a flame, which rapidly spread to adjoining
material equally susceptible. All efforts to
extininiish tho flames were abortive, and tho
carpenter had, to retire to save his own life.
The scene in the gallery, after the alarm was
raised, is described aa something horrible
even to contemplate. Up till noon to-day

Around the trunk of one was a scorched
buckskin undershirt, and beside the other
was a piece of braid, apparently a portion of
his stage dress. This afternoon a number of
men will be set to work to- clear awav the
wreck in the auditory. Hitherto their Ialiors

A coroner's jury was impaneled tins
morning and held a private session m the
stationhouse, adjourning to the burned the
ater: they took no evidence, and at noon ad
journed to meet at the coroner's office Satur
day evening. A. M. Palmer, one of the les
sees of the theater, gives the following
statement of the
NUMBER OF TEHSONS IN THE THEATER
Tuesday night 40-3 persons in the upper gal
lery, (500 persons in the dress-circle, 2-50 per
sons in the parquette, 21 actors and speaking
people, zv supernumeraries, 1U stage hands
and 1'2 musicians; total, 1018; or, including
dressers and other suborilinatcs, in all about
10o0 persons. A fault in the construction of
tlie burned building, and one to which there
is reason to believe the dreadful loss of life
in the gallery is in a large measure attributa
ble, was the use of a pamted cloth for ceiling.
The canvas caught easily and burned rapidly.
Of course the flames followed it up to the
top, making the dome a funnel of fire rieht
over the head of the people in the gallery.
It seems more than probable that the smoke
and fire, in the midst of which they were thus
placed, destroyed the lives of many persons

lie wa3 in the theater m citizen clothes when
the fire occurred. He was up in the dress
circle, and saw the flames burning the
scenery on the stage. He ran to the front to
get the doors open, and the actors and audi
ence quieted for a moment. He waited at the
doors till the spectators were all out, and
then closeil the doors to keep the draught
out. People were then coming down from
the gallery, but all at once thev stopped com
ing down, and he ran to see what was the
mutter (he referred to the first gallery). There
were two separate stairways leading up there,
and as I got to the top of the first flight of
staus there was a lady who, in coming down,
got her leg caught in the ballhters. A large
man fell over her, and others falling on him,
made a heap which those m the rear could
not pass. There were fully fifty or sixty
persons packed in a heap at the foot
of the second flight of stairs. The shurs
were open all the way down. From that
point, and above that point, the state stairs
were vacant four or five steps from the top.
At this time the smoke was very dense. It
was not three minutes after the fire broke out
till the curtain was lowered and took fire, and
this liad the effect of sending the flames up to
tlie gallery. I looked at it for about three
seconds, and then closed Uie door of the par
quette; the persons who were in a heap cried
to me to help them, and I did get some in tlie
rear to fall back until I got a man and a wo
man out; seeing those two get out, they all
rushed forward again and blocked the passage
up; I tried to extricate a woman whose leg
was caught in the railing, but she was held
fast; an usher came up to assist me and we
made a small place among them; we tore tlie
dresses off of some them, but we got them all
out; then I went up in the dress circle; I found
a woman there and took her out; there must
havo been other persons there, for I heard
crie3, but I could not see them
on account of smoke; I know there must have
been several other persons in the dress circle
who were overtaken by the fire; I was then
getting weak from the smoke, and I dropped
to the floor to get fresh air; the smoke was
black smoke, and had a very suffocating
smell; I am an old fireman, and I never ex
perienced smoke so suffocating; I was not in
the smoke more than a minute, and yet could
not breathe; the first and second galleries,
and even stairs, were at that time filled with
suffoaiting smoke; no human being could
live in that smoke two minutes; I heard a
thumping noise, as if some persons were
jumping out of the windows; at that time it
was utterly impossible to get up in the top
gallery, and I was nearly suffocated when I
got out; I know that the people were all
taken from the dress circle stairs, but I heard
the cries inside; I called out, "Where are
you?" but I got no answer; even
when I got down on the floor I heard a
thumping noLe as though they were jumping
out ol the upper caliery; if they had jumped
from the gallery to the dress circle the smoke
was so dense I could not have seen them;
there was no breakinrr nffhp kI.iiim -u-liilo I
j was there; I am pretty sure that all in tie
i dreH circle did not get out alive.

mere was even a larger crowd
ahocxd the Monorr
this evening than yesterday. A surgingluass
of people occupied the sidewalk in front of
the deadhouse and stretched into the middle
of the Etreet, and men nnd boys clambered
up on fences and wagons in the neighborhood,
i esterday the people who congregated in the
neighborhood of this building were quiet and
orderly, but to-day there was a spirit of levity
perceptible, as tlie fire was an event two days
old. No permits for admission were de
manded of those persons who could satisfy
the officers that they had lost friends or rela
tions by the fire. They were allowed to enter
from time to time, passing in the front door
and through the room on the right hand,
wliieb,eontained about thirty bodies lying on
the floor, none of which were identified, and
so on through themaller room. At the fur
ther.end of the building, back to the left
hand room in which some of the corpses were
lying upon marble slabs and tables in the cen
ter, upon such bits of clothing as remain upon
the bodies numbers were written hastily,
with lead pencils, on bits of paper which have
been pinned on tlie bodies, and when a body
is recognized the name and address are added
to the number, and then upon the receipt of
the coroner s permission, the corpse is placed
into a plain board coffin and driven to the ad
dress given by the person? who have claimed
it. There are
VEUT FEW IDENTIFICATIONS
however, and it is impossible that there can
be. Many features are for the most part un
recognizable. Trinkets and such things were
mostly lost in the crowd, and the clothing
has been either all lost or burned into mere
rags. At the Adains street morgue, formerly
known as the old Fulton market, the scene
was horrible in the extreme. On the floor lav
a large number of charred bodies, but in
many instances it was impossible to tell
whether they had lormeriy been male or le-
male, human or animal. In some cases the
mass was only about a handful of charred
bones and flesh, without atemnant of clothing
or otner property that could possibly lead to
identification. In other casts the clothing
was either torn from or burned off the bodies,
leaving but charred and blackened remains
bodies they cannot be called. My God,"
said one poor woman, as she gazed on a
charred mass of bones, "that may be my boy,
but who can prove it." Among the bodies
not so badly burned, was one of a man who
had evidently leaped from the gallery, as his
leg was broken short Off above the ankle.
THE 11EMAINS OF DR. FKANKISH,
a dentist who resided at Portland avenue
and Fulton street, was recognized by the
initials on his shirt-collar. It was the only
article of wearing apparel which could be
distinguished. A report of a most distress
ing case has been made by Captain Crafts, of
the second precinct. Mrs. P. Smith, a widow
lady, and her daughter, Mrs. Simpson, left
their residence, 141 Sands street, Tuesday
evening, to attend the theater. The only
other occupants of the house were a servant
girl and an orphan child whom Mrs. Simp
son had adopted. Neither of the ladies have
returned to their home, and, having no
friends in the city, no effort has been made
to identify their remains. The husband of
Mrs. Simpson was expected home from a long
voyage at the close ot the week. The under
takers were constantly driving up to the
morgue all the morning with wagons and
permits of removal of identified remains,
and the police had great difficulty in making
a passage-way fortf lem through the solidly
packed crowd which filled up the street in
fl'Ont of the. hnihling. HunurcUo orjcujie
have been to the stationhouse to-day inquir
ing after absent friends, and the pitiful
scenes of yesterday were re-enacted with ten
foW force. Two hundred and ninety-seven
bodies nave been deposited in the morgue and
the temporary one on Adams street. A wagon
load, containing ten bodies was on the way
a' the reporter left, making three hnndrw!
and nine in all. The mortality will
PROBABLY REACH THREE HUNDRED AND
FIFTY PERSONS.
The aldermanic committee on burials re
port that at eleven o'clock to-day one hun
dred and fifty-eight bodies were at the Ad
ams street market morgue, and ninety-six at
the city morgue. Mr. Sheridan Shook was
at the police station to-day. He had little to
say, and was intensely affected by the terri
ble affair. A. M. Palmer is ill from constant
attendance in Brooklyn since the disastsr, but
Mr. Lovaine Rogers, acting stage-manager
of the theater, and representing Messrs.
Shook and Palmer, the lessees, is em
powered and anxious to relieve any case of
immediate suffering consequent upon the
conflagration. The late treasurer, Mr. Gouge,
expressed the same sentiment of commisera
tion, and a
WILLINGNESS TO ASSIST THE UNFORTUNATE
in any matter possible. Mr. Shook has or
dered the Union Square theater, New York,
closed until idler the funeral of the victims
of this awful calamity. There was a report
in circulation this morning which reflected
seriously upon the police ot the first precinct.
It is said that a number ot persons got down
into the basement of the theater at the time
of tlie fire and were making their way out
through the grating, when the police shut
down the grating and ordered them to go out
the other way. A meeting was held to-day
of the joint board of aldermen and super
visors to make
ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE PUBLIC BURIAL

by a special commission that a plot for the

still remain unidentified. The funeral cere-
monies of a considerable number of the dead
were held in Brooklyn yesterday. The city
will bury the unrecognized and friendless vie-
tims of the disaster in Greenwood to-day, with
every mark of respect and grief. Mayor
Schroeder has issued a proclamation request-
ing the closing of places of business, and a
division of the National Guard is called
out to act as escort for the procession.
Public services in honor of the dead will be
held in the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the
New Park, and Hooley’s Theater on Sunday,
and many prominent clergymen will take part.
The companies of the Union Square and
Brooklyn Theater have made arrangements for
the funeral of Burroughs and Murdoch in the
Church of the Transfiguration in this city.
The work of relieving the people who have
been brought to want by the calamity has
been entered upon with activity, The search
of the ruins of the Brooklyn Theater still con-
tinues, but only one body and a few frag-
ments were found yesterday.

Careful computation of the number of persons lost
at the Brooklyn Theater fixes it at 2922, the number
officially returned by the coroners. The names of
all the persons are given in the two lists which Tue
TrinvNe publishes this morning. Of the total num-
ber 2A8 have been identified, and the full names and
addresses of these are given in THe TripuNe list under
the above head. The utmost care has been taken in the
compilation of thus terrible deatlr-roll. It is arranged
alphabetically in order to aid in its supervision by
all interested, The brief histories of the dead, which
formed a striking feature of yesterday's list, are
continued this morning, and some particulars of all
identified yesterday will be found. In yesterday's
Tript NE friends of the lost will find other partic-
ulars which are omitted in this issue, though
the names of all persons identified from the begin-
ning are in the list as now published. This repeti-

only by keeping an absolutely perfect alphabetical
list that duplication of names can be avoided. By

STILL SEARCHING IN THE RUINS.
ONLY ONE BODY AND SOME FRAGMENTS FOUND—
GREAT (ROWDS PRESSING TO SEE THE THEATER
—STRICTNESS OF THE POLICE GUARD—APPEAR-
ANCE OF THE RUINS,
The ruins of the Brooklyn Theater were the
objects of eager but melancholy interest from early morn-
ing till midnight yesterday. The detachment of the
13th Regiment was rofeved by a squad of police-
men at 7 o'clock. Inspector Waddy made his head-
quarters at the police station on Washington-st., adjoin-
ing the theater. The policemen guarded the door of the
station-house and the entrance to the theater, and
formed a cordon about the runs on Johnson-st. On the
opposite side of the strect from what was the main en-
trance to the theater the dense crowd of men, women,
and children remained alinost stationary for hours, gaz-
tng with speechless interest or a vacancy of countenance
at the ruins, On the side of the street next to the
theater people were allowed to pass but not wo loiter.
They came in groups from all directions, half a dozen
women frequently being together, in some cases
well dressed, in others wearing the habili-
ments of the poor. Often a group of sym-
pathizing women was seen about a distressed
friend. Hundreds of school children, rosy-cheeked
boys and girls, stopped on thelr way to and from school,
and not being permitted to look in at the glass doors of
the entrance, with troubled faces peered from a distance
through a hole which had deen made in the sidewalk
steps. A large erowd remained all day at the corner ot
Johnson and Washington-sts., where they had a view of
the fragment of wall left standing at the rear of the
theater. Boys of the street were not slow in finding out
that the stables in Flood's-alley furnished a view of the
interior of the lobby. They soon reappeared as ofien as
they were driven out by the police. A block below on
Washington-st. a mountebank took advantage of a crowd
to ply his business, but was prepared to drive away at a
moment's warning.
The main entrance front of the theater is very well pre-
served, though the cupola is barned alinost to a skeleton.
From tie street nothing could be seen of the interior.
A large American flag was flying al half-mast from the
cupolas. At noon the front of the Post Office was druped
in black and white from the pavement to the cornice.
Dieter's Hotel was also draped, and before evening sev-
eral other buildings on the block were likewise draved
in token of the public grief.
The search among the ruins for bodies and lost arti-
cles which might serve to identify the missing was re-
sumed at 7 o'clock in the morning by Culef-Enginecr
Neving, who had a force of 30 men at work. Four men
were cngaged in removing the debris, beginning with
the wall of the vestibule and proceeding carefully into
the lobby, which was hall dug over. Parts of human
bodies were found here, including a heart and a liver.
There was a mass of clothing, mostly rent, and of hats,
bonnets, and handkerchiefs, one of the handkerchiefs
bearing the name Chichester.” A silver watch was
found. The hands had stopped at 11:48, Other articles
discovered were a locket and chain, a few pieces of jew-
elry, and a great variety of Keys, with sevoral pocket
books and documents, and two newspapers,
Most of the force were at work in the ruins of the au-
ditorium, among the piers of the foundation. This was
the most difficult, as the remains of the Flood’s-alley wall
had to be removed. Af eight o'clock the only body re-
covered yesterday was found near the east wall of the
auditoriun, next to Flood's-alley, andidirectly under the
curve of the dress circle. Nothing remained but a char-
red trunk almost divested of flesh, A part of a hoop-
shirt was clinging to the remains, which are therefore
supposed to be those of a woman. A key was also
found, which is the only possible means by which this
body may be identified. During the afternoon the work-
men reached the space on the east side of the stage and
dug with care, hoping to find some articles which should
still further confirm the belief that the fragment of a
body found pear the remains of Mr. Burrougus was all
that was left of Mr. Murdoch. The precise spot was not
reached befere nightfall, when the work was suspended.
About the stage, fragments of costumes and the
Brussels carpet, rolled up and burned to crisp,
appeared. In the lobby a coat was found,
in the pocket of which was a conducter’s badge. It was
identified as belonging to Charles Andrews, who had the
cont stripped from him in the crush. He saved himself.
Toe body of the woman and the fragments of other
bodies were placed in a pine coffin and were not removed
to the Morgue til nightfall. It is possible that addi-
tional bodies may yet be exhumed, though it is believed
that the extent of the loss is fully revealed so far as hu-
man romains can tell the awful story.
Carbonate of lime was sosttered over the cinders and
ashes in the lobby, Only fow persans ware adaitied
by the doorway through Flood's-alley, where the crowd
was kept back by policemen. To a person standing in
the middie of the lobby the last terrible scenes of Tues-
day night Impressed themselves with ghastly vividness
upon the mind, A member of the coroner's jury was not
fully assured that the galleries had not fallen before
they were reached by the fire. He came back at 3 o'clock
to make a private examination. One of the floor joists
was found to be splintered, but the fracture appeared to
be comparatively, freshjas if done since the fire. Four
or five ends of floor jolsts, broken squarely off, were still
in the outside wall of the lobby, where the mass of
bodies was found. The other extremities of the joists
were charred, making it appear that the floor had not
fallen till one had been burned away.
Remnants of the lobby door opening on Flood’s-alley
were still hanging to the hinges. Mr. Rochford, the head
usher, stated, and may have thought, he unlocked this
door, but the testimony seems to be indisputable that it
was opened with axes and bars frem the outside. A
gentleman came to the ruins to confirm the statement of
Richard Lynch, a coal merchant, with whom he opened
this door. His description of the scenoc at this door was
of thrilling interest. He and Mr. Lynch were at Hunter's
saloon at the end of the alley. On getting the alarm they
ran up the alley and began to take horses out of the
stables. But hearing piteous shrieks and beatings on the
side of this lobby-door, they left the horses, procured
axes and beat in the door. Some time was consumed, 89
a crowbar was necessary to finish the demolition of the
door. The screams of tho confined victims filled every-
body in the alley with terror. The excitement of those
making the deliverance knew no bounds. When the door
was forced, the gentleman thinks, not more than six
came out. Two women and three or four men dropped
from the windows into the alley and were slightly in-
jured. Looking through the opening made by breakiug
down, the door nothing but black rolling smoke could be
geen. From the alley high up in the back gable two
hands were seen clinging to an upper gallery window.
The wretched man within had not strength to draw him-
self up, and died without loosening his grasp, This gen-
tleman states that 15 minutes after he reached the alley
entrance he heard the whole intetior falling to ruins.
The police office next to the theater, where Inspector
Waddy and Capt. Smith remained in charge, was visited
by numbers of persons seeking permits to visit the
Morgue or the ruins, Permission to tuspect the ruins
was denied even to aldermen of the city, Inspector
Waddy told the story of two stage attendants who got into
the cellar and came out through a coal shoot in the mid-
dle of the sidewalk. They were drawn forth by a police
man, who shouted at the top of his lungs into the cellar
for others to hear, but received no response. The In-
spector sald that inquiries were coming in from other
cities concerning persons who were in Brooklyn tempo-
rarily and had not been heard from since the fire, He
thought if the unidentified bodies could be kept till Sun-
day that friends from other cities would identify wore
of the dead. A boy was reported as having died yester-
day morning. He escaped, but Ww ith every shied of
clothing torn from him. Naked as he was, he ran to
Nelson-st., and, it is said, died from exposure.
Detective Butts brought William Bennett, a bricklayer,
to the station-house, and accused him of sciling perinits
to enter the Morgue for fiv cents apiece. A handful of
permits, believed to have been forged, was taken from
him. Bennett was under the iufluence of liquor, and in
his statement so stuititied himself that he was loc ked up.
When the bodies were removed from the thoater on
Wednesday all articles found in the clothing were placed
in separate pasteboard boxes. A room al No. 304 Fulton-
st. was rented, and there the boxes were ari anged ou
tables that the contents might be identified. Yi sterday
articles in about sixty of the boxes were fdentified as
belonging to the missing.
FEW BODIES REMAINING AT THE M( JRGUL.
THE WORK OF" IDENTIFICATION NEARLY COMPLETED
—TilE UNIDENTIFIED BODIES 10 BE BUKIED
THIS AFTERNUON.
The crowd visiting the Morgue at Wil-
loughby and Cantou-sts. was larger, if anything, yester-
aay, than on the day previous. The police had been worn
out by their extraordinary labors, and yesterday the
military took thelr places. The auly at the Morgue was
performed by a detachment from Company E of the 13th
Regiment, N. G., under the command of Licut. William
Gear. A space was kept clear in front of and near
the gate, and much better order was maintained
among the crowd than on Thursday. Great credit
also was due to Sergeant Corr of the Filth
Precinet Police and Patrick Maguire, keeper of
the Morgue, for iheir uniform courtesy ln assisting those
searoiing for the remains of relatives or
friends. It was evident that the majority of the visitors
at the Morgue yesterday were altrocied by tere
curiosity and the morbid desire to witness a horrible
sight. Atleast half of the visitors were women, some of
whom were recognized as regular attendants every day
ginee the calamity, and none of whom appeared to be
engaged in identifying any of the remains. Yesterday
also many children were present, sowe with their
parents, snd others, in groups of two or three, supearcd
to be schoolboys and girls, as they cacried their text
books in straps or under their arms, These were hurled
through the rooms and oat of the back door rapidly and
without puuch ceremony. About noon Dr. Shepard, the
County Physician, with Drs. J. C. Boaw and Miner, came
to the Morgue to perform such autopsies as the law re
quires. The bodies examined were those of Syducy
Evans, colored, of Hudson and DeKalb-aves., John
Hickey of No. 103 Fulton-st., and John Bresmon of No
300 Pearl-st., New-Youk, In all the cases iL was found
that death was due to asphyxia, or suffocation.
While the autopsics were being made no visitors were
permitted to enter the Morgue, but as soon as the work
was completed the stream of people again began to flow
steadily through the bullding. Some of the young woilien
were 50 shocked at the sickening sight which their mor-
bid curiosity had induced then to witness, that they
fainted as soon as they reached the outer door again.
The undertakers were busily engaged in conveying away
the identified bodles, for the removal of which periniis
bad been grauted by the coroner. Keoepor Maire re-
ceived notice from President Otterson of the Board of
Health that all the bodies that liad not been claimed by
10 o'clock this worning are to be placed in cofling and
futerved by the county to-day. The identification of the
bodies that were left in the Morgue yesterday afternoon
was much more dificult than before, as the remains
were badly disfigured, and few, If any, of the bodies had
much clothing upon them that could give any clew to
their identity. The trunk of a young girl, from which
tne extremities and a portion of the head had been
burned, had been placed in a box with fragments of
other bodies, becanse it was believed to be utterly unree-
ogunizable, Yesterday afternoon Le. Froidevaux, a wawch-
waker at No. 257 Columbia-st., cswe to the Morgue
to make a more thorough search than before for the re-
mains of his missing daughter. She was between 15 and
16 years of age, and had aecompanied her brother to the
theater on the fatal might, Tae brother was rescued,
though severely mjured, and was taken to the Long
Island College Hospitak It was very certain that the
sister had perished in the flames, as lu the rush to the
doors from the gallery the brother and sister were sep-
arated, ‘Fhe only remains of a tewale In the Morgue yes-
terday were at lengli positively identitied as those of
Rosa Froidevans, Her father found a small carring
whieh she had worn at the theater, tightly held by the
cartilage of her left ear. The flesh a ornament
bad been burned to a crisp, and the setting was bhiack-
ened and twisted by the fire Nevertheless the agua
marin stone was iu good condition and was fully 1den-
titted by the father,
Another body that was believed to be past any chanoo
of identification was recognizod ns albert BE
of No. 294 South Fourth-st. The ouly article founa with
this body wus a gray ribbed stocking on the left foot.
This was recognized by a brother, and the body was re-
moved to South Fourth-st. It was regarded as remurk-
able, on the other hand, that the body marked No, 23
had not been identited. Like the others the features
were not receguizable but the body was clothed iu a
diagonal check coat, white shirt, white undershirt and
drawers, aud In the poekets was a brass badge on which
was the word conductor,” a briatwood pipe, with four
stars cut on it with a peukuife, and a small pipe with a
cigarette holder for a mouth piece. Last ut the re-
mains of six persons were left at the Morgue which will
probably never be identified.
cI
VICTIMS AND VISITORS AT THE MARKET.
ATTEMPTS TO RECOGNIZE THE DEAD—CROWDS IN
AND AROUND THE BUILDING,
The improvised Morgue on Adams-st, was
open throughout Thursday ulght, but from ubout wid
night until 6:30 o'clock Friday morning no identifications
were attempted. A few bodies were carried thither late
at night, bus yesterday the only additions to the list of
dead were mere fragments of bodies, hopelessly muti
lated and beyond recognition. At 6:30 a. m. the erowd
of mourners began to gather, and at noon a larger num-
ber were present searching for thelr dead than at any
provious time. Bcores of women were there whose only
object was to gratify a morbid ana disgusting curiosity,
It wos frequently remarked by those whose duty kept
them on the spot that it could be understood how men
and curious schoolboys should gather to the awful scene,
but that the feeling which led women there to examine
and speculate over what bad no decent interest for them
was one supposed to be contrary to nature iteclf. The
officers were im a measure powveriess to prevent the en-
trance of those who had the Coroner's passes, and many
obtained these who had mot the slightest right to them.
Heartless and even brutal remsrks were in some in-
stances made by theses debased creatures as they picked
their way amen the mutilated sud charred remains
lying in long rows upon the floor. Several times an
effort, only partially successful, was made to clear the
room of those whom curiosity alone had brought there, but
who were
in a few moments it would be again filled. About a dozen
militiamen fn thelr uniforms acted as a guard, and pre-
vented the unaue crowding of any part of tie Morgue.
The appearance of th. bodies had not materially
changed daring the preceding day and night, save that
the streams of carbolic acid showered over them for
purposes of disinfection have fn many instances ren-
dered identification still harder, by washing away the
shreds of clothing which clung to them.
without the Morgue, on the streets, in restaurants and
stores, were the traces of tho terrible catastrophe in the
conversation and experiences of those who had escaped,
but in the receptacle of the dead was the awful reality.
Men who had seen nearly every phase of human suffering,
had seen every form of death, said that nothing in their
experience could equal the horror of the scene before
them. Laid upon the floor of the market in long,
straight rows, were the ghastly forms of the dead, sur-
rounded by groups of men and women who hoped and
yet feared to recognize in the mangled corpses relatives
or friends. A8 darkness drew on, candles were lighted
and placed upon or beside the bodies, and the work of
identification went forward. As a general thing, remark-
able composure was manifested by the persons present,
and few loud demonstrations of grief occurred. Every
one seemed to feel the need of self-control, and those
whose feelings yielded to the prolonged strain soon
checked themselves in the expression of their anguish.
It had been hoped that the natural propensities of thieves
would desert them in the presence of the appalling
calamity, but at least two instances occurred where
bodies were robbed. The sum of 85 cents, placed upon a
body, was stolen on Thursday, and yesterday it was
stated that a still smaller sum had been taken from the
pocket of one of the victims.
At 3 o'clock the erowd became so great as to endanger
the flooring of the old market, from which in several
places the upper boards had yielded to the pressure, and
hundreds of persons were peremplorily hurried into the
gtre t. As fast as permits could be secured the bodies
were removed in rude cofling to the homes of friends,
There were several sad instances where bodies, recognized
beyond doubt, were marked No friends,” and left for
the public burial. It was reported durfug the morning
that ail bodies unidentified at J o'clock yesterday after-
noon were to be boxed and removed, and that no further
attempt at recoguition would bs permitted, This news
was received by those who, not having found ther dead,
conld not bear the thought of giving up the search, with
expressions of grief and disappointment. One mother ex
claimed, bursting into tears,“ ITknow my boy is here, and
must find him.” It was announced later, however, that
the room would not be closed to the public until mid-
night, the latest hour to whieh it was regarded safe (0
allow the corpses to remain exposed. ‘Lhe chill air of
yesterday acted as a preveyilve, and it was not thought
that the remains would become infections if kept wet
with ecarbolic acid. At D o'clock, Dr. Oiterson, of the
Health Board, with several assistants, mado a earefal in-
gpection of the bodies gill remaining in tae building, and
ordered that Nox. 14, 33, 41, 52, GO, 71,72, 86,127, 130,

unsafe to teave them ancovered longer. At tiis hour,
when most of those who hil visited the
Adams Street Morgue had departed, the crowd

were still obliged to Keep the street barred. All day

INCIDENTS OF THE DISASTER.
One of the most striking things connected
with the early incidents of the fire was the effect pro-
duced upon the minds of many persous, especially
women, who were rescued from the burning building
There were in several places scenes resembling those of
a mad-house, Some grew silly, and when they were led
from the door, foolishly prattied of matters in ne
way connected with the tragedy. More seemed to lose
all consciousness of what was passing, and frantically
rushed here and there, exclalming loudly and gesticulat.
ing. One woman, led away by two men, earncsily
pleaded to be allowed to return, and evidently would
have endeavored to go back into the theater, where she
thought one of her friends still was, 80 determined
was she, that finally they were obliged to raise her
in their arms and carry her away. On the oppo.
site side of Washington-st another Woman
walked rapidly back and forth, shaking
ber head slowly, and muttering, He's a good one, good
one,” without seeming to be conscious of what she said,
In the station-house was one mau, bruised and burned
who required two men to keep him quiet. Stating up
suddenly and staring wildly, he would throw out his
arms and seem to be frightened by something he thought
he still saw, When quieted, his head sunk on his breast
and he was unconscious of what was passing. A young
woman of prepossessing appearauce acted ds if ine
toxlcated. Several times she barst into fits of
laughter, and talked bits of nonsense to those
cariug for her. Still others appeared stunned
an stupefied by what they had passed through, and re-
membered nothing of the scenes, A strong-looking man
said that after leaving his seat and starting for the exit
he had no recollection of what happened until he was
upon the street. The greater poriion of those who came
out, however, had a vivid recollection of the whole scene,
and recovered thelr presence of mind after the first
shock.
A man by the name of Burton succeeded in elimbing to
tue windows facing the dress-circle by means of alight
ning-rod attached to the building, and succeeded in res-
cu'ng a woman, whom he endeavored to earry down the
outside. In so doing be lost his balance when balf way
down, and fell upon his back, injuring himself very seri
ously, while the woman escaped unhurt,
A young lady, clothed in deep mourning, called at the
Police Station early on Thursday afternoon, inquiring for
her sister, Kitty West, who had written ber at Hartford
that she was to attend the Brooklyn Theater on Tuesday
with a young gentleman. Since then she had not heard
from her, and had come to Brooklyn to make inquiries,
She was unprepared for the dreadful truth, and almost
fainted as the sergeant told her what she must expect 0

VIEWS OF THE NEW-YORK HEALTH BOARD.
RESOLUTIONS PASSED BY THE HEALTH COMMISSION
ELS—OPINIONS OF GEN. SMITH.
The Brooklyn calamity was the subject of
consideration by the Health Board of this city yesterday.
President Chandler, Commissioner Janeway, and Gen,
Smith, President of the Police Board, were preseut and
expressed themselves as convinced that sowe ioamediate
action should be taken in reference to the fucill
ties for rapid exit from the New-York theaters in
case of fire. President Chandler offered a resolution that
the Mayor, Fire Commissioners, and Superiutendent of
Buildings be requested to meet with the Board of Health
on Dec. 12, to consider what measures will most speedily
aud effectively secure the safety of visitors at theaters
and other places of amusement.
Gen. Smith claimed that the Department of Buildings
alone was vested with the responsibility of compelling
the managers of theaters to provide sufficient means of
egress, and offered a resolution, which was adopted, that
President Chandler's resolutions be submitted to the
counsel of the board, to report on Dec. 11 as to the res
sponsibility of the Health Board in the malter.
In conversation with a reporter of THE TRIBUNE, Gen
Smith stated that he had supposed that the Board of Po-
lice and the Board of Health had authority to compel
the theater managers to provide more places of entrance
and exit, and also prevent the practice of placing
scats in the aisles. He found, however, that the Depart
ment of Buildings alone had jurisdiction in the matter,
and that the powers of the department were limited to
giving notice to theater mavagers that their places of
amusement were not suitably provided with means of
egress, and forbidding them to place obstructions in the
aisles. In ease the managers, after being
warned, continued to seat spectators in the
aisles, the Department of Buildings could only cause
them to be fined $10 for each offense. Gow. Swith
expressed the desire that some acon might soou be
taken by the Legislature, making it a eriminal offense
for theater managers to neglect providing sutliclens
means of egress, or to obstruct the aisles with extra
seats. Such action would enable the Police Departiuens
to effectually do awey with danger in attending theutors.
AID FOR THE SUFFERERS,
The Brooklyn Guild and Union for Christian
Work has visited mavy of the families bereaved by the
calamity, and has begun the work of relieving the desti-
tution caused by the death of many who have been the
sole dependence of their families. The Union is now re-
ceiving a stock of supplies at its depot, No, 20 Smith-st.,

dresses so torn from their back', aud
picked up by the police, were in the
police station next door to the theater.

"New York, Dec. 6. The fire iu the
Brooklyn theater Ia3t night was at
tended'by an appalling los3 of life,and
it is thought not less than one hundred
persons wero killed in the rush to the
exits or burned to death, being unable
to escape. The lire broke out during
the performance of the last scenco of
the "Two Orphans," in which Miss
Claxton playes the heroine on the
boat-house floor. Iu five minutes
more tho audience would have been
dismissed, and thero would have been
nothing more serious than a destruc
tion of property. Tho house was about
two-thirds filled, those below sitting
well forward toward the stage. For
those in the family circle, dress circle
and galleries thero was no way of es
cape except on Washington street.
The panic stricken people rushed pell
mell toward aud down the stairways.
The maiu exit became immediately
choked up and a scene of terror, con
fusion and distress ensued which beg
gars description. Just above the land
ing place of the stairway a woman, iu
the crush, had her foot pushed between
the banisters and fell. The crowd be
hind, pressed by the terrified people
still farther behind, fell over her aud
piled on top of each other, four or five
deep. The police from the station
house next door were promptly at the
scene, but owing to tho manner in
which the people wero piled ou lop of
each other and massed together, they
could extricate comparatively few,and
thc30 were all bruised, bleeding and
maimed.
Tho firemen got to work on the ruln3
shortly after daylight this morning.
They succeeded in getting a3 far as the
dress circle, where they tound a (rest
uumber of bodies and immediately be
gan the work of removal, and up to 11
o'clock sixty-five bodies had bien re
covered, and what appeared to be
twenty or thirty moro were seen in
tho basement, "into which they had
been precipitated by the falling of tha
burning floor. At tho polico station,
adjoining the burned theater, the
names of cighty-3ix persons missing
from their homes haye beeu registered.
Kate Claxton, at the preliminary in
quiry of Dro marshal, said that at tho
beginning of the la3t act, "just as tho
curtain went up, I heard a rumbling
noise on the stage, and two minute-
after I saw the flames. The fire seemed
to be all on tho stage. Mrs. Farren,
myself, Mr. Studley and Mr. Murdock
were ou tho stage at this timo. We
four remained there anil endeavored,
a3 best we could, to quiet the audi
ence and prevent n panic. I said to
the people 'Be quiet, we are be
tween you and the fire. The front
door is" onett, and the pas3ajre3 are
clear.' Not one of the audience jumped
on the stage. Tho flames wero then
coming down on us. I rau out and
jumped over several people. Mr. II.
S. Murdock, after endeavoring to calm
the fears of the panic stricken people,
went to his dressing room to get his
clothing and must havo been suf
focated." The work of identifying tho dead
will be difficult, for most of thom aro
burned beyond recognition. The on
ly mode ot identifying will be by per
sonal property found nttached to tha
bodies. Thtii far it U only evident
that the 11 lines made common havoc
with men, women and children. Short
ly before nine o'clock Rev. Futher Han
ley visited tho theater, and among the
bodies recognize the brother of Rev.
Father Kj lie. Father Kylie was pre
sent and recognized the body of hi a
brother. A body was taken from tLa
ruins, charred and blackened beyond
recognition. In the breast pocket of
his coat wore a number of cards bear
ing the name of Abraham Burnett iu
German text.
Bodies are cou3tanIy being removed
from the ruins aud are taken to tlu
morgue as fast as possible. It 13 ru
mored that a number of tho attached
of the theater aro burned. It seem
certain that Charlc3 Lott and his sou,
who were stationed in tho gallery, arc
among tne lost. Tho actors aud ac
tresses escaped front the stago into
Johnson street.
J. W. Thorp, stage manager, states
that the fire occurred in this manucr:
A drop was ignited from a border light
by some means inexplicable, as ono
was guarded from the other. He im
mediately directed the stage carpenter,
Mr. Weaver, and two supernumeraries
to endeavor to extinguish the flame,
but the difficulty was to reach the part
ok fire. The stage carpenter with tho
supernumeraries essayed to e fleet the
object by lowering the drop, but in so
doing added fuel to tho flames. Tho
scene the hut iu the play embraced
a ceiled apartment, audlheiustant tho
burning drop came iu contact with tho
inflammable ceiling it served to spread
the flames in a flash, as though powder
had previously been scattered about
the scenery. Tho entire propertic3
were iu a blaze. The usual avenues of
escape were thus summarily closed at
the rear, aud cxit,if ntall possible, had
to be made by the way of tho boxen
trance. All, except one or two, thii3
escaped. It h now bcltvcd that tho
uumber of the dead will bo about one
hundred and twenty-live.
Brooklyn, Dec. 6. Tho courts ad
journed this morning without trans
acting any business. There is intouso
excitement iu the city, and busines3 is
partially suspended. Park theatre has
been cloied torn week. Wagon loads
of rough boxes are arriving in front of
the theatre. Corpses arc placed in
them, and covered with tarpaulins and
carried to the morgue. Tho scene
grows more terrible every minute.
Men and women are crowding around
tho station-houe and theatre or en
trance making inquiries for missing
friends. In some instances whole fam
ilies have perished. The bodies pre
sent every form of contortion, just a
thev stiffened iu that last agony when
the floor gave away and they plunged
down in blinding smoke and flames.
Amsand leg3 are bent and twisted iu
every way; hands arc clenched anu
reached out as grasping for help.
The Evening Posta.yi that at about
11 o'clock a horriblo discovery was
made. In the middle of what was the
lobby of the theatre, lay an immense
pile of rubbish smouldering beams,
fragments of girders, aud other things
this heap was nearly opposite the
main entrance to the auditory of the
theatre. Beyond it was another heap,
marking the place where the stairs
where the stairs which led to the gal
lery fell. Under the heap first mention
ed a dead body was found, aud tho
firemen diligently prosecuted their
search iu that direction. With much
labor some of tho heaviest timber was
removed, a horrible sight was reveal
ed. Beucath that mound corpses lay
in rows heaped ono upon the other,
packed together with fearful solidity,
which told of tho great pressure to
which they had been subjected. How
many lay there, what their sex or age.
uo man could tell, aud at noon only
guesses could be made. Another ac
tor, Claude Burroughs, is now report
ed missing. Thus far, but three
corpses have been identified, thoso of
Hugh S. Eovcr and Nicholas Keily of
No. 117 Tillorv, and John Woods of 11
Fleet Place.
NewYokic Dec. 6. The Brooklyn
Argus states that up to one o'clock 91
bodies had been taken from the ruins
aud others were still visible lying in
layers four deep. The morgueis com
pletely filled, and the bodies arc now
carried to the old market building in
Adam3 street. They can't bo recognized
At two o'clock 115 bodies had been
recovered, and there are probably as
many more within the ruins. Somo
persons assert that none in the upper
gallery of the theater escaped. The
last man that left the stairs says that
behind him was a helpless, half suffo
cated crowd.
At four p. m. 175 bodies had been
taken from the ruins of tho theater.
The ruins arc still burning, making
the work of removing the bodies very
difficult. Flags are at half mast
throughout the city aud the theaters
arc draped mourning.
Horror upon horror accumulate as
the day advanced. Corpse after corpso
charred and blackened, was passed
out, and still tho pile of bodies in the
cellar did not seem to dimish. As the
number mounted up to 150 and 160 tho
belief that the number would reach to
200 grew into a certainty, and finally
at half past four the two hundreth
body was removed. Some were found
with limbs and hands burned off, and
nothing left but ghastly blackened
trunk.
At 5 o'clock the number had reached
220. Twenty bodies were taken out
iu half an hour. A look iuto the pit
at this time still showed a considera
ble number of corpses lying cro3swiso
liko sticks of wood, aud there wcro
apparently fifty or sixty more.
This was in the cellar under the ves
tibule, from where all the bodies taken
out to-day were removed. They lay
in a pile, apparently where thoy had
beeu pitched into the cellar when the
floor and stairway gave away,
At a late hour to-night 235 bodies
had been recovered. The fire marshal
who has made an examination of the
circumstances attending tho fire, is of
the opinion that at least 350 persons
perished in the flames. The most terrible calamity that has
occurred in the United States for many
years was the destruction of the
Brooklyn Theatre by file, in which
three hundred and fifty human beings
lost their lives in a few moments, and
a full account of which publish on tho
first and second pages of this paper.
It brought to mind the burning of the
Richmond theatre many jears rgo.
Whole" families perished, including
tho wealthy, intelligent and fashiona
ble. The terrible loss of life was not
so much due to the panic as lo the ma
terial of the ceiling which was cloth
saturated with oil paints.
The funeral of many victims took
place Sunday. The city was draped
in crape. All of the bells of the city
tolled mournfully as the long cortege of
a hundred hearses .wound their black
lengths along to the deep wide trench
were in one common grave the victims
were laid to rest. Of the Brooklyn horror, of which
wo published a special last week, we
print on tbo first page full particulars
as there were received up to tne an
though the daily papers, continuing
the terrible story upon this page, as
follows:
Tim rlirrmncmlKl (if the aWful'Cahim-
Itv Trliifh lins lmfalleil tllO city of
Diooklyn in the destruction of its
nrineinal theater bv fire, and conse
quent loss of life, have not yet been
realized. Enough is known, however,
to make it certain that the catastro
phe ranks among the most fatal of tho
kind ever recorded. According to tho
statements of all the parties who pro
fess to know an thing as to tho ori
gin of the fire, it began on tho stage.
The busincsa manager. Mr. Rogers,
savs that a niece ol canvas, out of
which tree, etc., are raadk, was
broken from its fastenings aud hung
from the flics immediately over one of
tho border liirhts. near tho center of
stanc. The canvas had bcsiun to
smoulder, and ths paint on it to crack
when the carpenter was directed to
asocial to one of the grooves and re
move tho dangerous object. He could
barely reach it with his hand, and he
drew it hastily up. Tho rapid motion
through the air ignited tho highly m-
flamablc canvas, causing it to burst
into a flame, which rapidly spread to
the adjoining material, equally sus
ceptible. All efforts to extinguish tho
flames were abortive, and tho carpen
ter had to retire to save hi3 own life.
The scene in the galleries, after the
alarm was raised, is described as
something horrible even to contem
plate. Up to noon to-da (7th), 315 bodies
had been removed." Ot these fifty
nine arc identified, some by remnants
of clothing, watches, chains, and such
articles, but few by tccir features.
The actoi-3, Claudo" Burroughs and
Harry S. Murdock, arc among the
identified.
This afternoon a number of men
will be sot to woik to clear away all
the wreck in the auditory. Hithcito
their labors havo been chiefly confined
to the space formerly occupied by the
lobby and stage, it is feared that
when a careful search is made in tho
auditor, that the bodies of a good
many men,who Ieapcd,in their frenzy,
from the galleries, will bo found. The
Police allow no person to enter with
in the walls of tho the theater, with
the exception of those engaged in the
search for the dead. The small parts
of the ceilings and floors of the theater
yet remaining, are in au unsafe condi
tion. A coroner's jury was impanncled
this morning, adjoining the burned
theater. TI1C7 took no evidence, and
at noon adjourned till Saturday even
ing. A. M. Palmer, one of the lessees
ot tho theater, gives the tollowing
statement of tho number of persons in
the theater Tuesday evening: 405 per
sons in the upper gallery; 300 pei'cons
in tho dress circle; 250 persons in Hie
parquettc; 21 actors and speaking
people; 20 supes, 10 stage bauds and
12 musicians; total 1,018; or including
dressers and other subordinates, 1,050
persons.
A fault in tho construction ot the
burned building, and oue to which
there is reason to believe the dreadful
loss of life in the gallery is in a large
measure attributable, was tho use of
painted cloth for the ceiling. The
canvas caught easily and burned rap
idly. Of course the flames followed it
to "the ventilator at the top, making
the dome a fumicl of tire, right over
the heads of tho people in the gallery.
It seems more than probable that the
smoke and fire, 111 the midst of which
they were thus placed, destroyed the
lives of mouy persons who might else
havo escaped, oven by the inadequate
stairway provided lor them. There
was even a laigcr crowd around the
morgue this evening than on yester
day. A surging mass of people occu
pied the sidewalk in front of tho dead
house, and stretched into the middle
of the street, and men and boys clam
bered upon tho fences aud wagons in
the neighborhood. Yesterday, tho
people who congregated in the neigh
borhood of this building, were quiet
and orderly, but to-day thero was a
spirit of levity perceptible, notwith
standing that tho fire was an event
only two days old. No permits for
admission were demanded of tho3c
persons who could satisfy the officers
that they had lost fi lends or relatives
by the fire, but were allowed to enter
from time to time, passing in the
front door and through the room on
the right hand, which contained about
thirty bodies lying on tne uoor. -None
have been identified so tar. Tho search
ers then passed through a smaller
room at the farther end of tho build
ing back to the left hand room, in
which some corpses were ling upon
marble slabs and tables in tho center.
Upon such bits ol clothing as remain
upon the bodies, numbers written
hastily, with lead pencils, on bits of
paper havo been pinned, and when a
body has been recognized the name
and address arc added to the number.
Upon receipt of the coroner's per
mission, the corpse is placed in a
plaiu coffin and driven to tho addres
given by the persons who have claimed
it. There are very few identifications,
however. It is impossible that there
can be, as many features are, for the
most part, unrecognizable. Trinkets,
and such things, were many of them
lost in tho crowd, aud the clothing has
been cither all destroyed or burned
into mere rags. At the Adams street
morgue, lonueriy Known as 1110 oiu
Fulton Market, the scene was horriplc
in the extreme. On the floor lay a
largo number of charred bodies, but
in many instances it was impossible
to tell whether they had formerly been
male or female, human or animal. In
some cases the mass was only about a
handful of charred bones and flesh,
without a remnant of clothing or oth
er property that "could possibly lead
to identification. In other cases the
clothing- was cither torn from or
burned olF the bodies, leaving but
charred and blackened remains, which
could not be called bodies. Among
the bodies not so badly burned, was
one of a man who had evidently leaped
from the gallery, as one leg wa9 broken
short off above the ankle. Tho re
mains of Dr. Prankish, a dentist, who
resides at Portland avenue and Fultou
street, were rocognized by the initials
on his shirt collar. It w'as tho only
article of his wearing apparel which
could be distinguished. A report of
a most distressing case has been made
bv Captain Crafts, of the second pre
cinct. Mrs. Smith, widow lady, and
her daughter, Mrs. Simpson, left their
residence, No. 11 Sands street, Tues
day evening to attend the theater.
The only other occupants of the house
were a servant girl and an orphan
child, whom Mrs. Simpson had adopt
ed. Neither of tho ladies have returned
to their home, aud having no friends
in the city, no effort has been made to
identify their remains. The husband,
of Mrs. Simpson is expected homo
from a long vovage at tho close of tho
week.
The undertakers were constantly
driving up to tho morguo all the morn
ing, with wagons and permits for the
removal of tho identified remains, and
the police had great difficulty in mak
ing a passage way for them through
the solidlv packed crowd which filled
tin tho street in front of the building.
Hundreds of people have been to the
station house to-day, inquiring after
absent friends, and the pitiful scenes
of vesterdav were re-enacted with ten
fold force. Two hundred and ninety
seven bodies have been deposited in
tho morgue and a temporary one on
Adams street. A wagon load of bod
ies was on the way when tho reporter
left, making 309 111 all' Tho mortality
will probably reach 350 persons. The
aldcrmanic commit tee on burials re
port that at 11 o'clock to-day 183 bod
ies were at the Adams street market
morgue, and 90 at tho city morguo.
Sheridan Shook was at the police
station to-day. lie had little to say,
aud was intensely aflectcd by the tcr
riblo afair. A. M. Palmer is ill from
his constant attendance in Brooklyn
since the disaster, but Mr. Rogcrs,aet
ing stage manager of the theater, and
representing Messrs. Shook and Palm
cr, the lessees, is empowered and is
anxious to relieve any case of immedi
ate suffering consequent upon the con
flagration. Tho lato treasurer, Gage,
expressed the same sentiment of com
miseration and willingness to assist
tho uufortunato in any manner pos
sible. Mr. Shook has ordered the
Union Squarolhcatcr, Now York, to
bo closed until after tho funeral of the
victims of this awlul calamity.
At a meeting of tho actors and act
resses, held on the 8lh, for tho benefit
of tho Brooklyn theater. BufTcrers,
every regulnr theater aud minstrel
troupe in New York aud Brooklyn
was represented. A large number "of
theatrical people were present. An
additional resolution was adopted
that every theatrical manager in the
country be asked to contribute the
proceeds of their performance to the
relief fund.
Brooklyn i3 literally walking in the
valley of the shadow of death. The
funerals of such of tho victims of the
theater disaster as havo been identi
fied, are taking place, and through the
streets in every part of the city hearses
aro going, bcaiiug thcrcnaius to cem
eteries. About thirty-live men arc at
work on tho ruins, and it is hoped that
the full extent of the calamity will be
definitely ascertained within tho .next
twenty-four hours. They have not
yet succeeded in uncovering the dress
circle, and it is therefore "still uncer
tain how many, if any, of the specta
tors in it perished.
One moro body was found this
morning in tho parquettc, aud also
two or three fragments of flesh that
may possibly belong cither to bodies
which have already been recovercd,or
lo others which have been almost to
tally consumed. Tho body was so
charred and disfigured as to bo un
recognizable. It was evidently that
of a woman, as a piece of hoopskirt
adhered to the icmaius.
The articles taken from the dead
have been deposited for identification,
and are guarded by a number of po
lice officers. Sinco 11 o'clock, when
the articles were arrayed for identifi
cation, they have been examined by a
large number of persons. The re
mains of Murdock and his brother
actor, Claude Burroughs,are in charge
of tho undertaker.
Several bodies were claimed at both
morgues to-day. One body, on which
was found a gold watch, was claimed
by no less than seven persons. In tho
temporary morguo thcro is quite a pile
of arms, legs and fragments of flesh.
The police central office and City
Hall arc heavily draped, and the largo
busiucss establishments aro putting on
tho habihaments of mourning. A
number of stores arc closed, and on
the door is a notice reading "Closed
in consequence of death in the family."
At the investigation which tho Fire
Marshal is making, John Lyons testi
fied that he was in the top "rallerv.and
first saw the fire through a crack in
the scenery on the left hand side of
tho stage. It was quite a largo flame.
When 1 heard tho cry of firc,my friend
and myself ran down stairs, and I
called him back again and we sat
down, but only for a minute. I
diopped over the bannisters at the
head of the stairs. When I got up a
policomau tried to push me back.
Several others jumped on top of me.
The stairs were crowded then, and
the police tried to keep tho crowd
back. There was also a crowd down
ahead of me, but I met with no Author
obstruction. Not half of the people
had got out of the gallery at the timo
I left. There was nothing to indicate
the breaking of the stairs when I came
down. The people were panic-stricken,
and were falling on each other.
There were very few women.
M. T.Bryan, 'who was in the par
quettc, testified "I do not think
there wcro six persons behind me
when I got out. I am sure when I lelt
aim got out there was not a man or
woman in the parquettc."
Eight bodies are still in the morgue,
aud eighty-three in the Adams street
market. Parts of some of tho corpses
have crumbled aud look like heaps of
offal. The carbolic acid is poured
over them hourly, bv order of the
Board of Health. The chloride ofl
limo scattered about the floor and the
decomposing limbs aud trunks in
creases the offensive smell of the place.
On further post mortem examina
tion it is believed that most of the
deaths were caused by suffocation.
At the services in tho Catholic
churches to-day reference was mado
to the disaster "and tho congregations
were called upon to make manifest
their Catholic charity pracr3 for tho
dead and pecuniary aid for the living.
The following testimony was taken
by the F10 Marshal John Brilc "I
was in the gallery nt the time ol the
fire, and when the alarm was given, all
made a rush; about a hundred got out
beforo I did. First saw it in the flics
over the stage, and the cry of fire was
raised behind. Murdock "went to tho
footlights aud requested all to be seat
ed. Saw others sit down again, aud
saw flakes of fire falling on the stage;
got up and went out when it increased.
Some one fell, aud then twenty-five or
thirty lell over mm; a rush ot lire and
smoke thcu cainc through liko a
whirlwind. John Turner, an old fire
man, said: 'Look out for yourself;
the place is all ablaze." Tho people
were panic-stricken, and cried out that
the stairs were falling behind them.
They begged some one for God's sake
to let them out. Did not sco tho stairs
fall. Thought that not more than
seventy-five people from the gallery
got out; there were, perhaps, fifty
women in the gallery. Turner was
buried to-day."
Charles Adams was in the dress,
circle. "First saw the fire in the
scenery on the left hand corner of the
stage from the audience; it was then
that tho cry of fire 'was given, aud all
started in a rush for the doors; told
the people to keep quiet and they did
so. Mr. Studlcy said, go, and go qui
etly. They then rushed out, and I got
knocked down, but got up again and
took out a lady who was with me.
Saw several ladles knocked down in
the parquettc and others au the vesti
bule. Thcro was even a flash of lire
to the ticket office. From tho dress
circle to tho front entrance the people
were all in a panic; women were
knocked down and the crowd rushed
over them. I think if the audience
had been requested to leave quietly
when the fire first broke out, they
could have been saved; there might
havo been trouble in the gallery. I
don't think all the people got out of
tho dress circle; the placo was very
hot when I left; 1 did not hear any
stairs break, but heard the firo crack
ling on the stage. Mr. Richardson was
in the gallery; we saw men with poles
trying to pull the fire down; sparks
were then falling; the actors tried to
quiet the audience, and some sat down
a moment. A panic ensued and they
all rushed for the door. There w.13 a
mass of people there when I got to the
door; in going down the first flight of
stairs all were pushing, but 011 their
feet; the lights were up at the first
landing near the box ollice; the lights
went out aud a man fell, aud I fell 011
top of him; then it seemed that all
who followed fell on that heap; the
place was dark and volumes of smoke
came up; I was on my face but was
familiar with tho stairs and got out
went down; there was no bannister
or hand rail. I looked back from tho
street, but saw no one coming; I don't
thiiiK any 0110 got clown irom the gal
lery after me; the police were dealing
the streets; J was about a minute ex
tricating myself from the crowd. Tno
jog or Iandiug on the stairs caused
the pcoplo to rail.'
Tho public funeral of tho unidenti
fied dead will take place on Saturday
instead of Sunday, as previously stat
ed. A memorial service, however,
will be held on Sunday. At noon to
morrow tho militia will assemble on
Schcmerhorn street, the right resting
on Flatbush avenue. The procession
will bo iu the following order: Police,
band, tho clergy in carriages, the
hearses escorted by militia and city
officers in carriages. The services in
the cemetery will consist of prayers,
addresses and singing by the choral
societies. The bodies will be taken

The laiaiing was completely blockaded. The
cries and shouts were perfectly terrible. Men
and women fell powerless. Tlie crush was

and big men rushed wildly over the smaller
ones. It took fully teu minutes to empty tlie
dress circle, but it ae?med like an hour.
Many men and woiueu were injured, an?l
some of them were severely hurt. Number*
of women fainted, and we were obliged to
carry them out. Fortunately there were lew
children present. The draft of air through
the theater was terrible.

BROOKLYN, Dec. 6.--It is now esti-I
mated that oue bundred and fifty lives I
were lost by the tire at the Brooklyn
Theater last night. Sixty-five bodies
have been removed from the ruins.
All that remains of the Brooklyn
Theater is a stnouldering heap of ruins.
Firemen and police are actively at work
in searoh of the charred remains of the
poor people who lost their lives in the
vain efttrt to escape from the smoke and
fiames which surrounded them.
The scene during the lire was a terri
ble one. It was a desperate rush and
struggle for life, and bodies of girls,
women and children, and mituy ol the
men unable to rem the doora
are now being removed from
the ruins, while friends and relatives
ot missing persons are crowded in tbe
Station-house, tearfully examining hats.

Miss Kate Claxton and Mrs. Farren
rushed out of Johnstoa lat.;eet in their
stage costumes, and were saved. Tee
names of eighty-six missing per$ons have
neon reported at the Btation.house, and
it is believed in some instances whole

canto general before the actors left the
stage. A wild rugh was made for the
door.
Women shrieked, struggled and faint
ed, men plunged in mad terror over
seats and fought their way to the door
like wild be tots. The aisles were
blocked, and as the fire danced and
hissed through the combustible ma-
chinery and darted out over the beads
of the orchestra the demoralization be-'
came complete.
In two minutes the stage was one
mass of &Imes. The heat was so in-,
tense that many who occupied the seats
nearest the stage sank helpless to the
floor, an-d were dragged out la an in
sensible eondition.
Mrs. Farren alludes to the panic as
something horrible to witness and im
possible to desoribe. It is believed none
of the employes lost, their lives.
If every bit of the scenery had been
drenChed in kerosene the fire could not
have spread more rapidly nor furiously.
Even betore any fire engine had re
sponded the auditorium was a sea of
lire.
The flames burst through the roof, and
gathering tore by this suet up into tile
air, (tarrying pieces of' the scenerv to a
dIstance of half a mile. In ten minutes
the fire had spread to every part of the
theater.
Tile Argus building and Post-office
Ivere threatened with destruction. At
midnight the fire Wag at Its height,
and the great auditorium was a
volcano of fire, the root had been scat
tered to the winds in cinders, and the
times, in a bright, mighty mass dancing
high in the air, preeented a terrible
spectacle.
Up to noon, eighty-seven dead bodies
had been recovered from the ruins. The
supposttiou now is that two hundred
persons wore killed.
Up to 8:30 o'clock this afternoon one
hundred and eighty-two bodies have
been taken from the ruins, and it is esti
mated that no less than one hundred
